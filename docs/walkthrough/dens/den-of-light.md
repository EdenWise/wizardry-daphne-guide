# Den of Light

!!! note "This page is still under construction, thank you for your understanding."

This den is different from the other dens in that there are green and yellow switches for certain big rooms around the map. Usually a nearby green or yellow switch corresponds to the nearest big room. The final room also requires both a green and yellow switch to be pressed. For non-boss rooms, they may or may lead to paths that contain a chest (usually they don't).
