# Introduction

## Tutorial Dungeon

After starting the game, you find yourself in a tough situation.

Follow the on-screen instructions and after some spooky scenes, you'll be prompted with a personality quiz.

### Creating Your Character

This quiz determines:
 - Your alignment - Good, Neutral, or Evil.
 - Your starting attributes (i.e. STR, DEX, etc.)

You'll be shown the result and prompted for confirmation after answering the questions.

Once you've accepted the result, you'll regain control of your character.

Explore the dungeon until you meet a ghostly Girl - have a chat with her and follow her instructions. 

### Combat!

Before long, you'll find yourself in combat with a Goblin - kick it's ass.

### Freedom?

After the cutscene you appear outdoors, rewarded with fresh air and... some bandits.

Kick their asses.

### Royal Capital Luknalia

After another cutscene, you enter a city - Royal Capital Luknalia.

Lets head to the Adventurer's Guild, and meet the nice lady - Arna!

She'll tell us a bit of information, and most importantly, show us how to summon Adventurers.

Once you're tuckered yourself exploring the town, you'll be asked politely to head back into the Beginning Abyss.
