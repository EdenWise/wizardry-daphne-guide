# Guarda Fortress - Greater Warped One

!!! warning "Under Construction - thank you for your patience"

## Saving the Duke

There are three routes to choose for the Gaurda Fortress Abyss:

1. Princess Pulgritte
2. Pontiff Dua Lipa
3. Admiral Avare

## Key Mechanics

### Corruption

Corruption is a central mechanic of this Abyss, with major changes depending on the level of Corruption.

Corruption is increased when your party enters the sight area of a Corruption Sentry.

Corruption cannot be decreased whilst in the Abyss, but can be changed by modifying Causality in the **Cursed Wheel**.

### Corruption Effects

**Fortress Appearance:** Slime becomes more prominent with high Corruption.

**Quest Availability:** Some quest-lines become unavailable as essential NPCs are driven insane or die as a result of high Corruption. This affects which endings are available.

**Monsters:** Different monsters spawn, with stronger monsters at lower Corruption. 

**Greater Warped One:** The Greater Warped One is much stronger at lower Corruption, gaining new abilities and increased damage and health.

### Golems

Golems walk forwards when activated, destroying traps, damaged walls, and sentries in their path until they reach a solid wall or door.

This ability is only available after defeating the Greater Warped One at least once.

## Walkthrough

You gain access to the Gaurda Fortress area once accepting the "Duke Ixion" request from the **Royal Capital Luknalia** Adventurer's Guild.

### Impregnable Fortress

1. Enter **Edge of Town** -> **Impregnable Fortress** and complete a short story segment granting you access to **Zone 1 -Old Secret Passage B1F-** by entering the Well in the south-east corner of the map.

### Zone 1 - Old Secret Passage B1F

#### Enemies
 - Skeleton Warrior
 - Skeleton Mage
 - Poltergeist
 - Sandman
 - **NEW - Combat Sentry**
 - **NEW - Corruption Sentry**

##### Combat Sentry

Combat Sentries are dangerous enemy spawns that patrol around the map in short fixed routes.

Once spotted, you will be able to see their sight area highlighted in orange on the map.

Entering their sight area will cause the sentry to chase your party, however their movement is much slower than regular enemies.

These encounters can be challenging for the unprepared party, featuring new enemies such as the Cyclops, and more powerful versions of regular enemies with increased health and damage.

##### Corruption Sentry

Entering the sight area of a Corruption Sentry will trigger a short cutscene and increase Corruption.

See [[Corruption]](#corruption) for more information about Corruption Sentries.

#### Walkthrough

1. Fight your way through B1F until you pass a Sentry to reach the **Minor Harken**.
2. Travel south from the Harken and descend the stairs to B2F.

### Zone 2 - Old Secret Passage B2F (WIP)

#### Enemies
- Skeleton Warrior
- Skeleton Mage
- Combat Sentry: Necromancer and Skeletons
- Corruption Sentry
- ?

This floor is full of hidden pit traps which will drop you into the floor below, B3F.

Fortunately this does not deal any damage to your party.

You will need to repeatedly trigger these traps to fall down to B3F and find stairs back to B2F.

#### Walkthrough

1. Navigate your way through the Pit Trap Puzzle to the final area of B3F.

#### Navigating the Pit Trap Puzzle
In order to navigate to the exit, follow the paths marked on these maps:

1. Red
2. Orange
3. Drop down the north-west most pitfall trap and follow the Light Blue line to a lever. Hit the Lever to open the Red door that blocks the Light Orange path.
4. Light Orange
5. Green
