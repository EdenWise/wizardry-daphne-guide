!!! warning "Under Construction - thank you for your patience"

### Man in Black

### Missing Companion

#### Requirements

- Attained [Guarda Fortress Abyss Good/True Ending](./greater-warped-one.md#good-ending) (needs confirmation).
- Liam (Alan and Lily's daughter) survives the ending.
- Hound companion survives.

#### Walkthrough

1. After accepting the quest, head to Edge of Town to receive more information.
2. Head to **Zone 5 -Prehistoric Corridor B3F-** and seek out the dog and adventurers.

##### Saving the Dog

**Boss: Offensive Golem**

Selecting the dog has you fight the offensive golem first, which will buff itself with an attack + accuracy buff for 4 turns, and it will have the capacity to one shot even tanks that are defending. It will generally spam an AOE frontline attack, but can sometimes do a column attack. You NEED a ninja to use dissipate level 1 (attack buff is removed first). Even then, you still preferably want the frontline to fully defend as it still hits extremely hard (unless you have tanky frontline with at least lvl 3 Makaltu in which you can attack every other turn on average) After dealing enough damage to the golem, it will give itself a smaller attack/accuracy buff which don't need to be dissipated (can defend this amount of damage). It will be problematic if it gets these buffs right before it rebuffs itself as then it'll be difficult to dispel the big attack buff. This golem has a LOT of HP and a LOT of defense (you will do 1 damage if you don't use a defense penetration attack). For reference, a 300x2 attack character will deal 1 damage with non-defense pen skills, and precision strike lvl 1 will do around 100x2.

##### Saving the Adventurers
**Boss: Defensive Golem**

Assuming you picked the dog first, the next fight is with the defensive golem which will buff itself on turn 1 with invulnerability (it will take 0 damage permanently). The only way to deal with this is to defend with ur frontline and go for openings. It will also spam the frontline AOE attack, but occasionally will basic attack. This lets you do 3000ish damage. It is similar to the other golem in that it will also give itself a small attack/accuracy buff after it loses around half of it's HP. It usually dies around 3 opening hits, so it probably has 10k HP. I assume the offensive golem also has 10k HP.

CCs do not work on these golems, but debuffs do. Taunt works but isn't effective in getting the offensive golem to basic attack. 

##### Saving the Dog and Adventurers

If you choose to save both the dog and adventurers at the same time, you will need to fight BOTH, and the invulnerability buff of the defensive golem applies to the offensive golem (but not the other way around for the offensive buff).

##### Notes

- If you only save the dog, you get nothing but the stated gold in the request.
