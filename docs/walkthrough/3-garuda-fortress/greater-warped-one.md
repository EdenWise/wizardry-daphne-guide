!!! warning "Under Construction - thank you for your patience"

## Snippets

### Golem Doll Chain
If it hasn't been posted here yet, in abyss 3 in zone 4 tunnel when you talk to the skellybro in 2nd run for a golem doll, you can trade it to dr. raimi at the tent for a mysterious root. Then apparently you can go to the royal capital and someone will trade it for a shiny rock (im not sure when this prompt comes up). You go back to guarda and trade it to the blacksmith who crafts a dagger with it. give the dagger to graham at the tent and he gives u a book
go to tavern to trade for seeds
