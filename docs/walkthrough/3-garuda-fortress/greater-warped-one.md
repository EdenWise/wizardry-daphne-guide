B2F and B3F together form a puzzle where you will need to drop down from B2F to B3F, and climb back up to B2F several times to reach B4F.

Follow the lines in this order from the B1F Harken:
1. Red
2. Orange
3. Drop down the north-west most pitfall trap and follow the Light Blue line to a lever. Hit the Lever to open the Red door that blocks the Light Orange path.
4. Light Orange
5. Green
