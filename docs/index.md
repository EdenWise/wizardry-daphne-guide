# Wizardry Variants Daphne Community Docsite

This docsite is maintained by the community of the [Wizardry Variants Daphne Discord Server](https://discord.gg/YjYmUCkBXK) and is a collaborative, ongoing work in progress.

## What is this site?

This is a consolidated collection of information about Wizardry Variants Daphne that includes, but is not limited to details about the Abysses, maps, Greater Warped Ones, requests, adventurers, bondmates, and various game mechanics. Some of this information includes step-by-step processes for completing a task, however this is not a comprehensive step by step walkthrough in its entirety.

This site will not hand hold you for all content - we as a community assume part of the fun in a game like this is the challenge of figuring out where you need to go and what you need to do. For particularly crucial elements, we might have those steps listed, but we do not assume that you need to be told the exact path to follow on a particular abyss floor to go from the entry point to the exit point. We also will not always tell you what to expect along the way. We expect you to be able to leverage the maps and information provided to overcome hurdles, but we do not plan to walk you through square by square.
