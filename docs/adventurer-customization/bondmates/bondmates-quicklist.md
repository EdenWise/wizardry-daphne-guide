### Farming strategy:
Using the Cursed Wheel, Leaping back to Fresh Start will reset most bondmate locations, and then immediately Leaping forward to Warped Scene will make most bondmate Requests available.  To hit most of the bondmates, after leaping to Warped Scene:  

1. Step right back up stairs to B7F, step into teleporter, return to Harken
2. Leap to B5F - revive Harry and Ira.
3. Return to town.  Visit Temple for Ira, pay 500G.
4. Go to Guild and accept Beheading Bunny, Save the Grandchildren, and Donato Requests.
5. Enter Abyss Entrance, take stairs to B1F.  Speak to Chris and Mudd. Complete Chris and Donato requests.
6. Harken to B3F. Rescue Mudd.
7. Harken to B4F. Complete all four rounds of Bunny request, get bond.  Rescue Mudd again, get bond.
8. Stairs down to B5F. Complete Grandchildren request. (Automatically return to town.)
9. Go to guild, turn in three requests. Get Donato and Mel bonds.  Optional - accept Abyss Heretics request. 
10. Enter Abyss, B5F, step down to B6F. Go through full level reviving Harry when you see him.
11. Return to town. Visit Ira at Temple, pay 500G.
12. Enter Abyss, B7F, go find Harry one more time. Get bond.
13. Return to town. Visit Ira at Temple, get bond.
14. Guild - accept Undead March quest.
15. Enter Abyss to B7F, win all 4 undead waves. Get bond. (Automatically return to town.)
16. Repeat Cursed Wheel Leaps.

Optional - Add Goblin Den to B3F part of cycle if you can avoid most fights and survive the Ambushes. (Recommend saving for levels 30 or 40.) Adding that or Albano to this gets very complicated.  Probably best to focus leveling each on their own.

!!! note "Albano"
    It's potentially possible to wheel ahead to The King's Rescue after step 15 then go to the edge of town to get Albano. This was possible, then it was not possible, then it was possible again, so we're not completely sure which is the intended behavior.

## Adventurer Bondmates

- All adventurers can be bondmates if you dismiss them once they reach max [trust](../../mechanics/trust/trust.md)

??? note "Adventurer Trust Icon"
    ![](img/adventurer-trust-icon.png)

??? note "Adventurer Bondmate Example"
    ![](img/adventurer-bondmate-example.png)

* Dismissed heroes with the flaming heart icon become bondmates that give a bonus to a certain base attribute (+1..+5, depending on bondmate level).
* The bondmate level of a dismissed adventurer seems to depend on the bondmates attached to it on dismissal. If the adventurer has two level 5 bondmates, the resulting bondmate will in most cases (but not always) be level 5 too. Attached bondmates are returned to the pool on dismissal and can be attached to someone else afterwards.
    * It's possible that this is a bug, as it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to have an adventurer bondmate level depend on it having bondmates when dismissed, but stranger things have happened.
* The quickest way to obtain a level 5 adventurer bondmate is to get them to level 30 (see xp farming) and bronze grade (see grade up exams), take them to beat Helmut and Octonarus, and if necessary finish with the well-known trust-farming methods (see affinity). When they have the flaming heart icon, attach two level 5 bondmates, then dismiss the hero.
    * This process is much faster when using adventurers that match the main character‘s alignment. Often, just beating both greater warped ones and bronze grade will be enough for the flaming heart for matching alignments.
    * There seems to be another factor, possibly a random element to this. Sometimes the resulting bondmate will be level 4 only. It is currently not known why.
* Bonuses from two adventurer bondmates with the same attribute do not stack.
    * This means that at most, you can only get up to +5 on a attribute from an adventurer bondmate. This severely limits the appeal of dismissing adventurers for bondmates, with the most common practical application of it being for speed tuning purposes.
* Contrary to regular bondmates, there is no additional bonus when attaching an adventurer bondmate to a hero of the same element.
