# Contracts

Upon completing [Expose the Intruder](../abyss-guides/3-guarda-fortress/requests.md#expose-the-intruder), you will unlock the ability to make contracts on specific characters by talking to Morgus, God of Death.
These contracts generally give a sizeable buff at a cost of a very drastic penalty.
