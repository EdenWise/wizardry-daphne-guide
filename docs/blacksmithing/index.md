# Blacksmithing Basics

Blacksmithing offers several methods for improving your weapons, armor and accessories, and is essential for strengthening your party.

## Enhance
 - Increases Enchantment Value up to a maximum of +20.
 - Increases Innate Attributes
 - At Enchantment Value +5, +10, +15 and +20, unlocks a new Blessing or improves an existing Blessing if one already exists in that slot.

Requires **Gold** and **Iron Ore**.

### Enchantment Inheritance

An alternate method of enhancing equipment by sacrificing existing equipment.

## Refine

Refining an item increases the value of a substat and requires a Refinement Stone for that attribute.

Refinement bonuses are lost if used before enhancing to +5, +10, +15, or +20.

For example, you can safely (without losing the refinement):
- Refine substat 1 after upgrading an item to +5.
- Refine substat 1 or 2 after upgrading an item to +10.
- Refine substat 1, 2 or 3 after upgrading an item to +15.
- Refine any substat after upgrading an item to +20.

Requires a matching Refinement Stone of the **Blessing** to improve.

Blacksmithing becomes available early in the game after your party enters the first major city, Royal Capital Luknalia.

## Extraction

Extracting destroys an item, with a small chance of producing an Alteration Stone or Refinement Stone that can be used to modify or increase substats on items.

The type of stone produced will be randomly selected from one of the substats on the item under extraction.

Only weapons, armor and accessories can be extracted.

### Alteration

Refining an item modifies a substat, and requires an Alteration Stone.

Alteration has some nuanced behavior to it.

* If you didn’t alter a slot, after +5 the game locks you to only being able to alter a random slot that already passed its checkpoint (so at +5 you get locked to slot 1), and then may switch to a different slot when you pass that next slot’s checkpoint (at +10 it’s 50/50 for slots 1/2 and at +15 it’s 33/33/33 for 1/2/3 etc)
* If you altered a slot before +5, you get locked to that slot until you enhance to its checkpoint +1… and then the game will roll an equal chance to switch you to one of the other checkpointed slots (it may just leave you on the same slot you already altered)
* Altering a slot After it reached its checkpoint will remove both initial and checkpoint boosts

### Enhancement Inheritance

Enhancement Inheritance sacrifices an existing enchanted item to increase the enchantment value of another item.

This helps save gold when changing to higher quality equipment when you have already enchanted your existing equipment.

## Advanced Blacksmithing

### Advanced Extraction

The star quality of an item being extracted determines the magnitude of the stones produced. 

Extracting higher quality items results in larger boni granted by the stones.

**Tip:** Altering a high quality item with a low-grade Stone and then extracting the resulting item will result in a higher quality Stone, as the game only considers **item quality** and **type of available substats** when generating a Stone, not the magnitude of the substats.

Full Alteration

A **Full Alteration Stone** allows you to reroll all unlocked substats on an item.

It is a very rare outcome from **Extraction**.
