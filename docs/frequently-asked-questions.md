# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### Are there different tiers of adventurers that we can get?
Yes! This can be seen if you look at the Drop Rates for Adventurer’s Remains. The different tiers are: 
* **Anonymous Adventurer** (example: Human-Fig)
* **General Adventurer** (example: Marianne)
* **Legendary Adventurer** (example: Lanavaille)

Interestingly, there doesn’t seem to be anything on an adventurer’s stats page that indicates what tier they are in.

### Is there permadeath in this game?
There is, however it is very difficult to trigger. First, you need to have an adventurer with lower than 50 Fortitude. Second, you need to fail in resurrecting that adventurer at the Temple, causing them to turn to ash. Third, you need to fail at resurrecting the adventurer from ash. At that point, they are gone for good. Fortitude continues to regenerate while a character is dead, so when in doubt, just wait for adventurer’s Fortitude to be above 50 before you try resurrecting from the Temple.

### If an adventurer is dead, does it still regain fortitude?
Yes!

### Why does my map look different than the ones in the guide?
For each floor, there are generally a few main rooms but the pathways to get between the main rooms can differ from player to player. While it’s possible to have a map that looks identical to someone else, it’s also possible to have your map be slightly different. This means not every spawn point for a particular request you encounter matches the spawn point someone else encounters. From what we can tell, every floor has a defined number of possible layouts that get loaded in for a player. We’re not sure how many possible layouts there are, though, so take any image you see of a map with a grain of salt, as yours could have differences.

### Wait, it’s possible to get an adventurer as a bondmate?
Yes! Although this isn’t something we recommend doing as the bonuses are very minor. In order to do this, you need to reach max affinity with your adventurer then dismiss them. Yep, that’s right. You say goodbye to them. This is only recommended to use for duplicates if you don’t have any other use for them, or if you’re a completionist and absolutely must have that bondmate.

### How do I know which teleporters to take on B6F of the Beginning Abyss?
Look around for the corpses near each teleporter room. They’ll give you a clue about which teleporter to take. Think about the position of the sun in the sky to help guide you. The first body flat out tells you to ignore one room. The second body mentions something about the light ahead. Think North. The third body mentions following the dying light. Think about a setting sun.

### How do I solve the statue puzzle on B6F of the Beginning Abyss
This depends on the clue you get. Each statue corresponds to a member of your party when facing the teleporter. In general, you want to only repair the statue at the position that corresponds with the member that fits the clue. The answer could be that no statue gets restored. If your clue is about Fighters but you don’t have a Fighter in your party, just walk through the teleporter.

### Do I have to walk past the poison on B7F of the Beginning Abyss every time?
No! There are 4 stone piles that you can reverse on B8F. Two of these create shortcuts to bypass the poison. Two create pathways to treasure.

### How do I increase an adventurer’s level past XX?
At specific levels (20, 30, and 40), you need to grade up to increase the level cap.

Grading up requires two items:
* One grade tag for each adventurer taking the grade exam (note that this does not count adventurers in the party that have already graded up).
* A grade marker that is obtained by taking the appropriate grade exam The specific grade tag required depends on the exam you’re taking.

The current exams are Lead, Bronze, and Iron. All exams require a tag of your current grade (so the Lead exam requires each member to have a No-Grade Tag, and the Iron exam requires each member to have a Bronze Grade Tag). Grade tags are not consumed on taking the exam - instead, they are consumed when grading up after you have successfully passed the exam and obtained the required grade marker.

The TL;DR is that to grade up, each adventurer needs a grade tag of their current grade, and they need to have been a part of the exam where you obtained the next grade marker.

### How do I get grade tags?
Dismiss adventurers and combine lower grade tags into higher grade tags. In addition, you get a few from the weekly request.

* Anonymous Adventurers (Human-Pri, etc) give 1 No Grade Tag when dismissed.
* General Adventurers (Chloe, Clarissa, Flut, etc) give 2 No Grade Tags when dismissed.
* Legendary Adventurers (Lanavaille, Adam, etc) give 1 No Grade Tag and 1 Iron Tag when dismissed.

These above tags assume you dismiss without leveling and grading up your adventurers. Dismissing higher grade adventurers results in a slight increase in the quality of grade tags you receive, however because it costs a grade tag to grade up an adventurer, the result works out to be identical.

**There is no benefit in grading up an adventurer before dismissing them**. The weekly requests starts with a 3 tag reward and increases to 4 tags at a certain point. This isn’t confirmed, but it seems to be when your MC is level 40 in any class, possibly also requiring the MC having changed to another class.

### Help! I’m drowning! What do I do?
You need to attempt to leave the area through both the upper left and upper right sections of the room you’re in, as well as attempt to go back into the current before you’re able to activate the statue to drain the water. Heal with items as needed and take as few steps as possible!

## Character Questions
### Do bonus points actually give more points?
Maybe.

I've encountered three Benjamin with the following stat breakdowns:
* +6 bonus points, stats (16, 9, 12, 18, 17, 7, 8)
* +5 bonus points, stats (16, 9, 12, 18, 17, 7, 9)
* +5 bonus points, stats (16, 9, 12, 18, 17, 7, 8)

Between the first and second, there was a change in the bonus points but no change in the total stats of the character. In this case, the bonus points were effectively "assignable" points and not bonus points. However the first has 1 true bonus point over the 3rd. If this is accurate, it means that higher bonus points does not necessarily guarantee higher total points. It could just be a higher number of assignable points resulting in the same total number of points.

It's also possible that bonus points are truly that - extra bonus points, and that each character has a base set of level 1 stats with the possibility of having an extra 1 hidden bonus point applied to one stat. If this is accurate, the second Benjamin has a +1 hidden bonus point in Luck.

**This is currently a subject of testing and debate among the community, and this will be updated once we know more.**

### How should I spend my bonus points on X character?
In the long run, this really doesn't matter. There is also no true community consensus. Some people recommend putting all the bonus points towards the character's primary stat. Other people recommend putting all of the bonus points towards speed. Some people recommend splitting them between the character's primary stat, speed, and vitality. There is no wrong way to do this, and when you get to level 30+, it's very easy to have a character's points in a stat be in the 30s and 40s, so a few more points here and there won't make or break a character. There is no way for you to "brick" a character by choosing a specific point distribution.

### What should I do with my duplicicates of X character?
There's no hard or fast rule on this either. I put some of my personal thoughts and suggestions in the Character Analysis tab, so feel free to follow those if you'd like. You can never go wrong by saving a duplicate for future use, though.

### What are character duplicates used for?
They can be used to: 1\. Increase a character's Discipline level 2\. Increase a character's unique skill level 3\. Inherit a character's inheritable unique skill to another character (or your MC) 4\. Dismiss for Grade Tags While dismissing a Legendardy character seems scary, it's possible that for some characters, that will be the absolute best value of their duplicates due to the fact that dismissing a level 1 Legendary character that has not completed a grade-up exam will give you 1 No Grade Tag and 1 Iron Grade Tag. Grade tags could easily be a bottleneck as we get to higher levels.

### Should I pull on X character?
This will always come down to personal preference, and whales, dolphins, and F2P players will all have different thoughts. Nobody can tell you how you should spend your money or your pulls. The Character Analysis tab will have some thoughts on different characters that you can use to hopefully make informed decisions that you are happy with.

### If I have both regular and Wanderer Lana, should I merge them?
Yes. Note that Wanderer Lana currently has the wrong skills, so we're not completely sure what the merge behavior is supposed to be. We will find out once skills get adjusted.

### Is there a limit to the number of skills I can inherit on a character?
No! At least not that we’re aware of at this time!
