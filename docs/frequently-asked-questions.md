# Frequently Asked Questions

## Gacha Questions

### How do I get more bones for pulls?
As you play that game, you'll collect occasional bones from NPCs, enemy drops, chests, log-in rewards, and the mausoleum. Some of these are on monthly and weekly timers.

### What bones should I buy for my pulls?
Generally, you want to buy the green or purple bones for the featured banner or various packages that are offered as one-time, monthly, or weekly purchases. Buying `Adventurer's Remains` is not recommended.

### Will limited adventurers be added to the standard banner?
Supposedly yes, although this has not happened yet and we don't know when it will.

### Should I only pull on limited banners?
While limited banners are the best banners to pull on, the `Adventurer Bones` and `Legendary Bones` you accrue will pull from the standard banner.

### If I have all the general pool legendary adventurers, should I save my `Adventurer Bones` and `Legendary Bones` or use them?
This is ultimately up to you. By saving, you can use them once limited adventurers are added to the general pool. We don't know when this will happen or if all limited adventurers will be added at some point. There is definitely value to using them, as this game has some of the best overall uses of duplicates, since skill inheritance (and to an arguably lesser degree, Discipline) are extremely valuable for improving the strength and effectiveness of your party.

### Is there a Pity System?
No, there is not a pity system.

### Is there a Spark System?
Yes, there is a Spark System. Every pull on a limited banner gives you 1 currency token for that limited banner's exchange. These tokens can be used to purchase skill books, adventurer and legendary bones, featured bones, and gacha equipment.

### Do my currency tokens carry over to other banners?
Potentially. Currency tokens are specific to that banner, so if you accrue 60 tokens for Limited Adventurer X, those 60 tokens cannot be used on Limited Adventurer Y's upcoming banner. That being said, it's very likely that those 60 tokens for Limited Adventurer X will be usable months in the future if and when Limited Adventurer X's banner reruns. As of March 10, 2025, only one banner has seen a rerun.

### Since 100 tokens are needed to Spark a featured Legendary, how many gems will that cost?
Assuming you're only buying the 11-count of featured legendary bones with your gems, it'll take 18000 gems to reach 99 tokens, or 18200 to reach 100 tokens.

### I got two copies of an adventurer and they have different stats. Is that normal?
Characters do have variations in base stats, their bonus points (up to 10) and their Fortitude (80, 90, 100). If you intend on doing a lot of summons, don't feel like you have to invest in the first version you get. That being said, the variations in stats, bonus points, and Fortitude are all extremely minor.

### What is the difference between Gems of Org and Gems of Erin?
Gems of Org (Green) are your commonly-earned (green) gems, while Gems of Erin (Purple) are only purchased with real money.

### Why does a featured legendary have two banners?
The first banner can only be pulled on using bones purchased with Gems of Erin. This banner has a guaranteed chance to get 1 of 3 random gacha equipment pieces with every copy of the featured legendary you get.

The second banner can be pulled in with Gems of Org and does not include the gacha equipment.

### Is the gacha equipment worth it?
For the majority of the player base, no. There is a lot of randomness to the gacha equipment. First, there's no guarantee you'll get the equipment piece that you want. Second, if you get the equipment piece you want, it can vary drastically in quality. Third, in order to fully maximize a single piece of gacha equipment, you need 9 copies of that specific item.

### Are adventurer banners the only things I should spend my gems on?
No! There are other things you might want to spend your gems on, including weekly class change scrolls and skill books for inheritance.

### I'm looking to spend some money. Are there any good packs I should buy?
This ultimately comes down to personal preference, but feel free to check out our [Purchase Evaluation page](./appendices/purchase-evaluation.md) to help make an informed decision!

## General Questions

### How do I access detailed in-game information about races, stats, classes, types, etc?
Go to the game Settings (gear icon) and click on `Help`. The Help section has a ton of information for you to absorb!

### Are there different tiers of adventurers that we can get?
Yes! This can be seen if you look at the Drop Rates for Adventurer’s Remains. The different tiers are: 

* **Anonymous Adventurer** (example: Human-Fig)
* **General Adventurer** (example: Marianne)
* **Legendary Adventurer** (example: Lanavaille)

Interestingly, there doesn’t seem to be anything on an adventurer’s stats page that indicates what tier they are in.

### Is there permadeath in this game?
There is, however it is very difficult to trigger. First, you need to have an adventurer with lower than 50 Fortitude. Second, you need to fail in resurrecting that adventurer at the Temple, causing them to turn to ash. Third, you need to fail at resurrecting the adventurer from ash. At that point, they are gone for good. Fortitude continues to regenerate while a character is dead, so when in doubt, just wait for adventurer’s Fortitude to be above 50 before you try resurrecting from the Temple.

### How often does Fortitude regenerate?
An adventurer restores 1 Fortitude every 6 minutes.

### If an adventurer is dead, does it still regain Fortitude?
Yes!

### I changed my adventurer's class with a scroll? Can I change it again?
You can, but you need another scroll to do so. Each scroll is a one-time use consumable.

### Why does my map look different than the ones in the guide?
For each floor, there are generally a few main rooms but the pathways to get between the main rooms can differ from player to player. While it’s possible to have a map that looks identical to someone else, it’s also possible to have your map be slightly different. This means not every spawn point for a particular request you encounter matches the spawn point someone else encounters. From what we can tell, every floor has a defined number of possible layouts that get loaded in for a player. We’re not sure how many possible layouts there are, though, so take any image you see of a map with a grain of salt, as yours could have differences.

### Wait, it’s possible to get an adventurer as a bondmate?
Yes! Although this isn’t something we recommend doing as the bonuses are very minor. In order to do this, you need to reach max trust with your adventurer then dismiss them. Yep, that’s right. You say goodbye to them. This is only recommended to use for duplicates if you don’t have any other use for them, or if you’re a completionist and absolutely must have that bondmate.

### How do I know which teleporters to take on B6F of the Beginning Abyss?
Look around for the corpses near each teleporter room. They’ll give you a clue about which teleporter to take. Think about the position of the sun in the sky to help guide you. The first body flat out tells you to ignore one room. The second body mentions something about the light ahead. Think North. The third body mentions following the dying light. Think about a setting sun.

### How do I solve the statue puzzle on B6F of the Beginning Abyss
This depends on the clue you get, which can change everytime you enter the level. Each statue corresponds to a member of your party when facing the teleporter. In general, you want to only repair the statue at the position that corresponds with the member or members that fits the clue. The answer could be that no statue gets restored.  The elf in the Tavern will tell you about Races and Classes using the same language used in the clues.

* "Ubiquitous race" = Humans (including main character)
* "Wise and long-lives race" = Elves
* "Brave Fighters" = Fighter (not Wanderer)
* "Skillfull" = Thief
* "Weakest" = Lowest Strength
* "Wise" = Highest I.Q.

If you get the answer right the teleporter will take you to a room with the exit stairs.  From there you will have to proceed down to B7F.

### Do I have to walk past the poison on B7F of the Beginning Abyss every time?
No! There are 4 stone piles that you can reverse on B8F. Two of these create shortcuts to bypass the poison. Two create pathways to treasure.

### How do I increase an adventurer’s level past XX?
At specific levels (20, 30, and 40), you need to grade up to increase the level cap.

Grading up requires two items:

* One grade tag for each adventurer taking the grade exam (note that this does not count adventurers in the party that have already graded up).
* A grade marker that is obtained by taking the appropriate grade exam The specific grade tag required depends on the exam you’re taking.

The current exams are Lead, Bronze, and Iron. All exams require a tag of your current grade (so the Lead exam requires each member to have a No-Grade Tag, and the Iron exam requires each member to have a Bronze Grade Tag). Grade tags are not consumed on taking the exam - instead, they are consumed when grading up after you have successfully passed the exam and obtained the required grade marker.

The TL;DR is that to grade up, each adventurer needs a grade tag of their current grade, and they need to have been a part of the exam where you obtained the next grade marker.

### How do I get grade tags?
Dismiss adventurers and combine lower grade tags into higher grade tags. In addition, you get a few from the weekly request. When dismissed, all adventurers will give you a grade tag that corresponds to their current grade. General and Legendary adventurers will give an additional grade tag as well.

* Anonymous Adventurers (Human-Pri, etc) give 1 grade tag that corresponds to their current grade.
* General Adventurers (Chloe, Clarissa, Flut, etc) give 1 grade tag that corresponds to their current grade, plus an additional 1 no-grade tag when dismissed.
* Legendary Adventurers (Lanavaille, Adam, etc) give 1 grade tag that corresponds to their current grade, plus an additional 1 iron grade tag when dismissed.

Due to the fact that it costs grade tags to increase an adventurer's grade, the increased value of tags you get is offset by the cost to grade up.

**There is no benefit in grading up an adventurer before dismissing them**. The weekly requests starts with a 3 tag reward and increases to 4 tags at a certain point. This isn’t confirmed, but it seems to be when your MC is level 40 in any class, possibly also requiring the MC having changed to another class.

### How do I swap lower grade tags for a higher grade?

### Help! I’m drowning! What do I do?
You need to attempt to leave the area through both the upper left and upper right sections of the room you’re in, as well as attempt to go back into the current before you’re able to activate the statue to drain the water. Heal with items as needed and take as few steps as possible!

## Character Questions

### What is Merging and should I do it?
Merging is a unique option that appears when an adventurer has two different styles. At the time of writing this, Merging is only available to Lanavaille and Flut. When you merge the two styles, you get a single adventurer that has the option to swap styles. In addition, that adventurer gets a new passive skill called `Contiguous States of Mind` that results in a minor 1 point increase to a few substats.

When a unit is merged, there are some things that carry over and some things that do not. All inherited skills learned by one style are shared with the other style, so you do not lose any skill inherits by swapping styles. For example, if your Standard Lanavaille has `Queen of War and Love` at level 3, and Wandering Princess Lanavaille has `Queen of War and Love` at level 1, the merged adventurer will retain the level 3 version. I do not know what happens if you merge an adventurer that has a level 3 version of the skill with an adventurer that has a level 2 version of the skill. I suspect the higher value would override the lower value instead of adding them together, but I have not confirmed this.

Each style, however, has its own Discipline skill and non-inheritable Unique skill. Any Discipline levels that have been given to one style do not carry over to the other style. For example, if you have Standard Lanavaille at Discipline 3, then you switch to Wandering Princess Lanavaille at Discipline 1, the Standard Lanavaille Discipline 3 skills are not also given to Wandering Princess Lanavaille.

According to in-game text, the merged adventurer also has the maximum number of bonus points across both styles. I haven't tested this, but in theory that means if you had 10 bonus points on Standard Lanavaille that you applied to Vitality and 6 bonus points for Wandering Princess Lanavaille that you applied to Strength, the merged adventurer would have 10 bonus points. I assume these 10 would remain applied to Vitality, but I have not confirmed this.

Ultimately, there is no reason not to merge an adventurer when you have the opportunity, regardless of who the adventurer is. You'll have to make a decision at that point which style you prefer to use. A minor stat gain with either style is better than no stat gain with neither style.

### What should I do with my duplicates of X character?
There's no hard or fast rule on this either. I put some of my personal thoughts and suggestions in the Character Analysis tab, so feel free to follow those if you'd like. You can never go wrong by saving a duplicate for future use, though.

### What are character duplicates used for?
They can be used to:

1. Increase a character's Discipline level
2. Increase a character's unique skill level 
3. Inherit a character's inheritable unique skill to another character (or your MC) 
4. Dismiss for Grade Tags While dismissing a Legendary character seems scary, it's possible that for some characters, that will be the absolute best value of their duplicates due to the fact that dismissing a level 1 Legendary character that has not completed a grade-up exam will give you 1 No Grade Tag and 1 Iron Grade Tag. Grade tags could easily be a bottleneck as we get to higher levels.

### Should I use my duplicates for Discipline or Inheritance?
This is an extremely frequently asked and hotly debated question, and there is no general, community-wide consensus. Both are potentially solid options. The following is TheAxolotl's opinion - feel free to consider it, but I encourage you to form your own opinion, as well.

To be blunt, I am not a big fan of Discipline in general. It's fine - more stats are always good, and if you go as far as getting up to Discipline 9, you can get a hefty ~28 added to most stats (and potentially more to the featured stats). The problem I have is that the value per dupe spent on Discipline is relatively low. You can read more about it [here](./mechanics/stats-and-discipline.md#discipline) but up to Discipline 6, it's roughly +2 stats per dupe (not skill level). Between 7 and 9, it's roughly +1.5 stats per dupe.

I consider there being three main breakpoints for Discipline:
1. Discipline 1: This unlocks the passive skill, and while it doesn't make a massive tangible impact on performance, I personally hate having locked skills on adventurers I use
2. Discipline 6: This maximizes the +2 stats per level rate and gives us roughly +16 stats for 8 dupes (9 copies total)
3. Discipline 9: Might as well go all out

An honorable mention goes to Disciplines 2 and 5, which are the last of the Disc levels where 1 Dupe = 1 Disc (albeit to get to 5, you do have to use 2 dupes for Disc 3).

Alternatively, Skill Inheritance can have equivalent or better impact on overall party performance for a similar or lesser dupe cost, particularly when you consider that skills generally see a jump in effectiveness on odd levels. Discipline 3 takes 4 dupes to achieve. With those 4 dupes, you could increase a Legendary Adventurer's skill level to level 3 (costing you 3 dupes) and still have a single dupe left over to either get to Disc 1 or inherit that skill on another adventurer, like your MC.

Is Discipline bad? Not at all - stat increases are always good. Is Discipline better than Skill Inherit? This is very debatable, but my opinion is very rarely.

What do I do with my dupes? I have a general process of:

1. First dupe - Discipline 1, strictly for my OCD. I don't like locked skills.
2. Additional duplicates - inherit to the MC or other adventurers OR get the featured Legendary's skill to an odd level (3 is a great target, 5 or 7 are good if you have a lot of dupes) for a noticeable damage boost
3. Once I hit the skill levels I want on whatever adventurers I want to give it to, only then will I consider going for more Discipline levels

### Should I pull on X character?
This will always come down to personal preference, and whales, dolphins, and F2P players will all have different thoughts. Nobody can tell you how you should spend your money or your pulls. The Character Analysis tab will have some thoughts on different characters that you can use to hopefully make informed decisions that you are happy with.

### Is there a limit to the number of skills I can inherit on a character?
No! At least not that we’re aware of at this time!
