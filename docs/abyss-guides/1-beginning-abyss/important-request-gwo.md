    ### Tips
    
    #### Watch for Stuns
    
    Since **Sweeping Tail Strike** can stun your healer, ensure you have potions ready to sustain the party if healing is delayed.

    #### Exploit Vulnerabilities
      - Equip **Air-elemental weapons** like the **Sword of Breeze** to maximize damage output.
      - If you have a Mage specializing in Air magic, use their abilities. If not, consider using **Jarmil** and his inherent Air spell, **FERU**, for single-target damage.
    
    #### Manage Debuffs
      - Be prepared for **Corrosive Liquid**, which lowers armor on your frontline, making physical attacks more dangerous.

   2. Go back to the dungeon and choose “Keep trying to talk to Albano” when trying to get him to leave dungeon  
   3. Complete the Fluorescent Flower Delivery Request

   2. When approaching Helmut on B8, choose the dialogue option to stop the debris  

### Labyrinth Cleared

   1. Complete the Cazula Root Delivery quest so you can give it to Vernant to use on the Craftsmen before the Helmut fight

## Greater Warped One

### Helmut

#### Battle Tips

* Weak to air, so `FERU` from mages (can be inherited from `Jarmil`) and the Sword of the Breeze will be very helpful
* Give the `Digging Mattock` to a front-liner that is not the MC so they can help clear the debris piles he creates
* `MASOLOTU` and `MAKALTU` can increase your front line's evasion and Defense Power respectively, lowering the incoming damage
* `PORTO` can be used to increase one adventurer's action speed while `BATILGREF` can reduce his Evasion and Action Speed
* `BALAFEOS` and `DILTO` can reduce his Attack Power and Accuracy respectively, lowering the incoming damage
* `MORLIS` can decrease his Defense Power, increasing the non-spell damage your party deals
* Mages should keep `Mental Unity` up so they can quickly clear any adds he spawns with a line spell

#### Right Arm of Reversal Usage

* Use it on one (or more in subsequent turns) of the debris piles he creates to clear them so your front line can hit him again.
