# Grade Exams

Grade exams are necessary for an adventurer to grade up (Increase max level limit). They only count for characters within the party that pass the exam without dying. Adventurers cannot grade up before the MC. It is possible to skip the grade exam by purchasing the grade exam item from the Jeweler's Shop (After beating the exam once), but this method is inefficient and overpriced. 

Tags are also required for a grade up alongside passing the exam.

**Special Notes:**

- Boss summons adds every few rounds. Save AoE clears for them. If have legendary units with Secret Arts, place them in back middle position to use them here.  
- Boss is undead. Bring undead slayer weapons if possible, or a lot of magic scrolls.  
- Boss sometimes skips turn.  
- Boss only has 2 moves, both attack 1 unit on the front row. 1 is a multihit, 1 is a normal hit. Not really threatening, just heal up after.
- Running away from the fight will reset the adds he spawns with. You can use this to your advantage and keep running away until he spawns with only Vorpal Bunnies, as they can be killed very quickly and easily.

**Special Notes**:

- Boss doesn’t summon any adds  
- Boss is weak to wind  
- Boss is susceptible to Opening
- Mobs on the way to boss can mostly be dealt with Scroll of Rockfall, except Air Entities. Those need Fire.  
- Boss hits like a truck.  
  - Tail Swipe AoE hits all front row with chance to stun.  
  - Jump attack hits 1 front row, swaps that column’s front and back.  
  - Buildup leads to Stinger next hit, hits 1 column with chance to fear. Block or take big damage.  
- As usual, stock inventory full of healing potions to save on MP on the way to boss.

## Steel Exam

**Special Notes**

- There is a single boss room and two paths to get there.
    - The left path favors physical damage. All enemies have extremely high magic defense.
    - The right path favors magic damage. All enemies have extremely high physical defense.
- All enemies are stationary and you cannot avoid getting into fights.
- The mage at the start tells you explicitly that you `won't be able to find any gaps to exploit`. This means that you are unable to rely on Openings as a strategy.
- The boss encounter consists of a Minotaur and a Succubus together
    - Kill the succubus first, then the Minotaur.
    - Leverage DILTO, MORLIS, MACALDIA, and any other buff/debuff spells at your disposal.
