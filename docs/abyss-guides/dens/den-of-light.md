# Den of Light

This den is different from the other dens in that there are green and yellow switches for certain big rooms around the map. Usually a green or yellow switch corresponds to the nearest big room. The final room also requires both a green and yellow switch to be pressed. For non-boss rooms, they may or may lead to paths that contain a chest (usually they don't).

??? note "Requirements"
      This den is only unlocked after [Stopping the Blackmailer and saving the Duke](#stop-the-blackmailer-and-save-the-duke)

The den drops Mid, High, and Fine grade ore randomly.
