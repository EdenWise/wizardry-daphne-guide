# Trade Waterways
The abyss in the Port Town Grand Legion is the Trade Waterways, and it is filled predominantly with water enemies. This makes Earth equipment and spells very powerful. While not required by any means, they can make progressing through the abyss significantly easier. In addition, there are a few scripted fights and areas where you could find yourself stuck and needing to Accept Death unless you have a Hook of Harken with you. In general, it's a fantastic idea to keep one around at all times!

## Suggested Preparation
To minimize delays and casualties, proper preparation is key. Here’s what you need to know:

* Enemy Vulnerabilities:
    * Most enemies in this dungeon are sea creatures vulnerable to earth damage.
    * Fire-based damage is largely ineffective as enemies have natural resistance to it.
        * Interestingly, water-based damage deals neutral damage to water enemies, so you are okay using it if you don't have any earth damage dealers.
* Obtaining Earth Gear:
    * After completing the first dungeon, you’ll unlock a sub-dungeon called the Den of Earth.
    * This area is crucial for farming the following:
        * Earth-based weapons and armor: Ideal for dealing damage and gaining protection from water-based attacks.
        * Upgrade Materials: Farm low-grade ore to enhance weapons and gear to 5 to 9.
    * Note that it's not required to go here, and the drop rate of useful earth equipment is very low, so many folks don't consider it worth their time to farm here for earth equipment. Instead, some will farm here for the oar and just use good equipment that they get along the way.

When upgrading gear, keep the following in mind:

* Stat Boosts at Milestones:
    * For items that are green or blue (rare or higher), upgrading to +5 provides an extra boost to the first stat displayed.
    * Additional milestone upgrades at +10, +15, and +20 further enhance the item's stats.
* Grade Matters:
    * Pay attention to the grade of the item, indicated by the stars in the top-right corner.
    * Higher-grade items receive greater stat increases at milestone upgrades.
        * To maximize your investment, avoid upgrading items that are below a +3 grade.

Please see [the blacksmithing section](../blacksmithing/index.md) for more information about what you can do with your equipment.

## Alternative Strategies:
* If Earth gear isn’t available, upgrade your existing equipment to +4, +5, or higher to unlock or enhance weapon stats (e.g., from white-tier to green-tier gear).
    * Note that it is possible to complete the abyss without having equipment higher than +4 and +5, however if you get a great piece of equipment, there's no harm in taking it higher!
* Use Earth-based spells like Erlik, Maerlik, and Laerlik for additional damage against enemies.

## Recommended Level:
A good target is to be around level 30, as enemy levels are comparable, but many people jump in immediately once it becomes available, even if you're a lower level when you rescue the king.

## Navigating Dungeon Gimmicks:
* Water Statues:
    * These statues create rivers that control movement throughout the map, often forcing you into specific locations.
    * Bring a Hook of Harken to retreat if your party is too injured to proceed.
    * Later in the dungeon, on Trade Channel 4th Street, you’ll encounter an event that allows you to disable these statues.
* Locked Doors:
    * Red-marked doors on the minimap are inaccessible until the end of the dungeon.
    * Near the dungeon's conclusion, an NPC on a ship will give you a key to unlock these doors, just before the arena segment.
