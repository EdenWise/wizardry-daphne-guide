# Party Construction
When organizing your party in Wizardry, proper formation plays a crucial role in survival and efficiency during combat. Below are two common formations, each with its strengths and ideal scenarios for use.

Note that these are examples of ways you can build your party, but they are not the only way. Be creative and find a strategy that works with your team!

## Formation 1: Balanced Setup
<b>Front Row:</b> Main Character, Knight, Fighter

<b>Back Row:</b> Priest, Thief, Mage

### Overview:
This formation offers a balanced approach, suitable for early to mid-game. The front row absorbs damage, while the back row supports and deals consistent but sustainable damage.

<b>Key Advantages:</b>

* Durable Frontline: The Knight and Fighter provide a solid defense, soaking up damage effectively.
* Supportive Backline:
    * The Priest ensures the teamâ€™s survival with healing and status ailment removal.
    * The Thief can deal early damage and delay enemy actions.
    * The Mage contributes manageable magic damage without exhausting their mana pool too quickly.

<b>Best Use:</b>

Ideal for early-game content or when you need a reliable and straightforward approach to combat. The focus is on sustainability rather than overwhelming damage output.

## Formation 2: Offensive Nuking Strategy
<b>Front Row:</b> Thief, Main Character, Fighter or Knight

<b>Back Row:</b> Priest, Mage, Mage

### Overview:
This formation prioritizes offensive capabilities and is most effective in the late game when resources, like mana, are abundant. The Thief in the frontline doubles as an evasive off-tank, allowing for an aggressive backline setup.

<b>Key Advantages:</b>

* Evasion Tank: The Thief, equipped with a dagger or one-handed sword, can stack evasion, minimizing damage taken while contributing to front-row damage output.
* Flexible Main Character: Depending on your build, the main character can act as a hybrid fighter.
* High Damage Backline:
    * Two Mages allow for devastating area-of-effect (AOE) spells, ideal for quickly clearing enemies.
        * When fighting bosses and strong single enemies, two Mages allows for faster debuffing, which can greatly improve your party's damage and longevity
    * The Priest provides backup healing and utility, ensuring the team can recover from unexpected damage.

<b>Best Use:</b>

This setup shines in late-game scenarios where mana is plentiful, enabling Mages to unleash powerful AOE or specialty spells. However, in early-game (levels 1-30), limited mana reserves make it less viable as Mages cannot sustain high-cost spells.

## Tips for Choosing the Right Formation
* Adapt to Resource Availability:
    * Early-game: Focus on balance and sustainability.
    * Late-game: Leverage offensive capabilities with strong AOE magic.
* Equip Strategically:
    * Prioritize evasion for Thieves in Formation 2.
    * Stack action speed for Mages to maximize early spellcasting impact.
* Understand Enemy Patterns:
    * Use Formation 1 for prolonged battles where endurance matters.
    * Opt for Formation 2 when quick eliminations are needed.
