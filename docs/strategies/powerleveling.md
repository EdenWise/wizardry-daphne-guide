# Powerleveling
## Basics

Powereleveling refers to leveling up a low-level character quickly by defeating
high-level enemies with the assistance of a high-level party. In this text, the
term is applied liberally to refer to any kind of experience farming
optimisation.

A nuke refers to an all-rows AoE spell. All mages gain some element nuke at
Lv.40, and legendary Mages + Alice have additional "Secret of" versions. These
are typically required for efficient farming.

When leveling up a character from Lv.1 onwards, it is imperative to keep the
target character's level below the threshold for the area, where gained
experience starts dropping. There are a few ways to achieve this:

* Remove the target character from party before Inn visit to avoid level up
* In case of MC, change class before Inn visit to avoid level up
* Use in-dungeon fountains for camping[^1] to replenish HP/MP/SP, but without
  gaining levels. Teleporting out of a dungeon and back in again allows
  re-using fountains.

[^1]: A good opportunity for also building trust with party members.


## Undead March

After reaching B8F, a request "Undead March" becomes available, consisting of
four waves of almost exclusively undead enemies. This request gives 13,058 EXP
per completion. Once you're strong enough to dispatch the waves with
Mage/Priest nukes, this farm is quite fast, doable in under four minutes. This
results in roughly 200,000 EXP per hour.

If you have Alice, a single nuke is enough to clear a whole wave. Other
characters untested, but should also be serviceable at least as a pair, casting
two consecutive nukes per wave.

Experience gains per character level:

* Lv.20: Full
* Lv.30: 66%
* Lv.39: 33%
* Lv.40: 16%

This means, the farm is only really good for ungraded characters, capped at
Lv.20.

### Strategy

Place MC in front row, rest don't matter as long as you can cast nuke(s).
Ensure your spellcaster(s) always go before MC, to deal with the rare occasion
when a nuke misses an enemy. Also make sure your MC is sufficiently equipped to
dispatch any still-standing enemy in a single strike.

Steps:

* Cursed Wheel to "Warped Scene". This lands you at the entrance of B8F.
* Leave the dungeon by taking stairs to B7F, teleport to the entrance and use
  Harken.
* Visit Guild to accept request "Undead March".
* Return to B7F to complete the request.
* Return to town, visit Inn before next round.

Turning the mission in after completion yields some gold, but also takes ~30s
and is entirely optional.


## Repel Enemy Forces

This mission becomes available after reaching 7th District in Port Town. Benefits
are much higher threshold (Lv.40) for maximum gains and ability to bail out of
the mission and immediately start over, without any additional hassle.
Typically first two waves are defeated, then bail out and repeat.
