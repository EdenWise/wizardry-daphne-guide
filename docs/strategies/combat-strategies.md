# Combat Strategies and Combinations

These strategies are effective in both early-game when your resources are low and late game when select fights are extremely difficult.

## Defense and Counterattack Strategy (Openings):
* Defend with one or more front-row adventurers to reliably trigger Openings for increased damage.
    * Mimics, Arena Bosses (Reprobus Brothers, Shagtis, Gessi), Oar Collectors, Minotaurs, and Old Castle Ruins bosses all enemies that can reliably have Opening applied to them.
    * Details of how Openings work can be found in [the mechanics section](../mechanics/damage-mechanics.md#openings)
* When to Use:
    * When outnumbered or facing overwhelming and powerful enemies.
* How It Works:
    * Have your frontline characters use `Defend` to absorb attacks and create Openings.
    * Attacked opened enemies with high-damage skills.
    * Use the opportunity to heal critical characters with your Priest while your frontline holds the line.
    * Benefits:
        * Defense increases survivability by boosting stats and reducing damage taken.
        * Exploiting Openings to deal significant damage, turning the tide of battle.

## Sleep Tactics (Katino):
* Why Use Sleep?
    * Sleep is a cheap and effective crowd-control spell that targets a row of enemies.
    * It reduces enemy actions by forcing them to "skip" their turn while trying to wake up.
* How to Use Sleep Effectively:
    * Cast Sleep on a row of enemies.
    * Focus attacks on enemies not affected by Sleep to reduce their numbers.
    * If you attack a sleeping enemy, they will take an automatic critical hit (x2 or x3 damage).
        * This applies to both physical and magical damage. If you run two mages, it's often more cost-effective to sleep with one mage and use a row damage spell with the other, rather than using row damage spells with both.
    * Key Tips:
        * Even at Rank 1, Sleep remains effective up to level 50.
        * If available, use characters who can inherit Asha’s Sleep skill for added versatility.

## Delay Attack
A useful tactic for dealing with stronger enemies and bosses is leveraging the Thief’s skill, Delay Attack. This ability can be particularly effective in controlling the flow of battle.

### How Delay Attack Works:
* Purpose: Delay Attack pushes back an enemy’s turn, potentially giving your party additional actions before the enemy can strike.
* Chaining: In some cases, you can chain Delay Attack, allowing your Thief’s turn to come up again before the enemy gets a chance to act.
* Boss Resistance: Be aware that bosses typically have high resistance to this skill. While the first use may succeed, subsequent attempts have a significantly reduced chance of working.

### Strategy Example:
* Start with Delay Attack:
    * Use the Thief to push back the enemy’s turn, disrupting their action sequence.
* Follow Up with Crowd Control:
    * Have your Knight or Mage use abilities like Sleep or Stun to further delay the enemy’s turn and waste their action.
* Capitalize on the Advantage:
    * While the enemy is incapacitated, focus your party’s attacks to deal as much damage as possible.
* Repeat if Possible:
    * If Delay Attack is successful again, continue the cycle to prevent the enemy from attacking.
    * Aim to burn down the enemy quickly before they can retaliate.

This tactic is highly effective against stronger enemies that rely on heavy, infrequent attacks. However, for bosses with resistance to crowd-control effects, this approach may require adjustments to avoid relying solely on chaining Delay Attack.

## Revival
When a party member dies, you get an opportunity to revive them, but the
animation to hit the circle on first attempt is very fast and difficult to
hit.

There are two tricks to doing it consistently that people have had luck with:

* Press the revive as soon as the circle animation starts.
   * This is most consistent, if you set your game to run at 30fps.
   * If running at 60fps, then the correct timing is to press just a little bit after the animation starts, maybe 300-500ms later.
   * Do note that the target circle gets smaller according to dead character's fortitude, and so this trick also becomes less useful.
* Tap on the screen immediately as (or slightly after) your MC touches the dead adventurer's back.

## Key Takeaways
* Openings are essential for both regular encounters and boss fights. Use them strategically for maximum effectiveness.
* Sleep is invaluable from early to mid-game for controlling crowds and disrupting enemy actions, requiring minimal investment.
* Controlling turn order with Delay Attack can be extremely beneficial in making sure you get necessary damage, heals, or other crowd control in before enemies attack.
* Adapt your strategies to available resources:
    * Use counterattacks and defense when overwhelmed.
    * Focus on action economy to increase survivability in challenging encounters.
