# The Trade Waterways

Note: There are areas where you are carried by a strong current. You must unlock the ability to reverse the water statues. Some have a timer to become cursed again. Some areas will be completely submerged. You should lure monsters out of the water in these areas or they\`ll be stronger

    !!! note
        When you’re locked in the room and drowning, you need to attempt to leave the area through both the upper left and upper right sections of the room you’re in, as well as attempt to go back into the current before you’re able to activate the statue to drain the water. Heal with items as needed and take as few steps as possible\!
