## Adventurer Reviews

??? info "TheAxolotl's Analysis"

    Here's what's great about Raffaello being released right now. He's a great adventurer to skip in order to save for whatever we get in the anniversary! With that out of the way, let's dig into his kit a bit.

    First, we'll talk about his Bones of Obsessive Love passive. This is pretty lackluster. Yes, he restores MP when he kills something (2 MP, I believe). No, this is not inheritable. No, priests won't often have the turns available to deal damage. No, even when it happens, priests won't often be the ones to land the kill. I love MP restoration, but I can't imagine he'd be landing enough kills to make it worthwhile. One important thing to note is that even though his signature spell deals damage to a row, if you kill more than 1 enemy with that spell, he only gets a restoration amount equal to one enemy. There also seems to be a bug where his spell is the only thing that triggers this restoration. That will likely get fixed, but still - not great.

    Now, let's talk about his Alchemized Anima Dissolution spell. This is weird. First, it's a combination of a MA damaging spell a MA healing spell, where the damage can be targeted against either row, but the heal is only for the front row, regardless of position. This isn't that bad since the front row is likely what's needing healing the most. Early tests seem to indicate that at skill level 1, when he uses it, the heal is somewhere around 40% of the damage dealt and the damage is roughly 10 damage per PIE, while it gets used by someone else through inherit, the heal is closer to 15%, with roughly 6-7 damage per PIE. The fact that this is PIE-based is the strange part, since there's nothing we can currently do with gear to improve it. It's literally as static of a heal as possible, however it has a comparatively high MP cost. The one benefit of having it be locked to PIE is that he's not reliant on Divine Power to heal. This would let you effectively build him as a battle priest.

    His Discipline is also weird in that it's the first Discipline we've seen that boosts a Trait (Piety) instead of a stat. Unfortunately, Piety is up there with Vitality as a very underwhelming Trait to boost.

    Keeping this short for now, and I might add more later. I love the idea of his kit. I think it's really fun and would be a welcome addition, however the implementation of it is what is strange. A priest isn't going to be able to do too much with this due to having better things to spend their turns on, and having the damage+heal locked to Piety is a bizarre choice. Even if you wanted to run a damage priest, the MC or Abenius could fit that bill easier. The one saving grace I could see is that you could literally gear him out as a DPS, complete with damage-oriented skill inherits, and his healing won't be negatively impacted. He could actually make a decent battle priest, however there are much better ways across the board to provide better damage and utility.

    Raffoello would make a good ninja turtle tho.

## Adventurer Pull Plans

    Definitely saving for the anniversary.
    
## Duplicate Usage

* Inherit to increase the magnitude of his spell's damage and healing capabilities
* Discipline if you really want more MP and Piety
