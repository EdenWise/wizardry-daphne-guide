## Adventurer Reviews

!!! info "TheAxolotl's Analysis"
    
    Alice is a fantastic unit to pull, and will likely be a staple in most folks' parties for a long while. Not only is she our first Legendary priest, but both of her skills are fantastic. Increasing her buff/debuff turn count by 1 means she gets an extra turn to heal, deal damage, or apply another buff/debuff before needing to reapply the initial. Furthermore, her damage increase to a row can apply to our current best damage dealers (Adam, Yeka, Gerulf, and a Neutral or Evil MC). Alice is no slouch in the damage department herself, either, being able to hit hard with single target Light damage that is based on her Divine Power and also deals increased damage to undead.

    Changing her class to Mage will give her a wider selection of spells, as well, making her a very well-rounded Adventurer for support or damage purposes.

    To make things even better, many other characters will benefit from Alice duplicates. Inheriting her skill on your other favorite buffers/debuffers will allow them to each provide an extra turn for their buffs/debuffs!

    It has been reported that the turn duration increase from her Blessing of Agora skill adds one to the counter at rank three, so it's possible to get at least a 5-turn duration on buffs and debuffs, which adds to the strength increasing her skill through inheritence.

    If you pull Alice, she will be a fantastic addition to your team!

## Duplicate Usage

* Inherit her skill on other buffers/debuffers you use. Note that this should include any damage dealers that have self-buffing or boss-debuffing capabilities.
* If you plan to use Alice, increasing her Discipline will increase her damage and healing.
* Save for future use.
