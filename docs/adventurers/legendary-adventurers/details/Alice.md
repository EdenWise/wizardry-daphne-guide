## Duplicate Usage:

1. Inherit her skill on other buffers/debuffers you use. Note that this should include any damage dealers that have self-buffing or boss-debuffing capabilities. See note above for potential bug.
2. If you plan to use Alice (you should), increasing her Discipline will increase her damage and healing.
3. Save for future use.
