## Adventurer Reviews

!!! info "TheAxolotl's Analysis"

    Like Iarumas, Berkanan is a bit of an interesting adventure. She is also a hybrid between a Fighter and a Mage, and compared to Iarumas, she actually has a better all around passive set. Having both Way of the Warrior and Way of the Mage means she has both a solid scaling damage multiplier, as well as a solid MP passive MP reduction for some of her spells.

    Coin of Power allows her to equip one-handed and two-handed swords, which pretty much cements her as a front line adventurer. In addition, it increases physical-oriented stats.

    True Words of Fire is a very unique spell. At a glance, it's HALITO that can apply two debuffs. Both of these debuffs will stack with other sources of the same debuff, but you'll want to keep in mind the debuff limit. This spell is going to take two of the three spots. One big unknown at this time is how exactly the level-based damage of this spell works. It will presumably hit harder than HALITO, but it's too soon to say how much harder, and will be something to keep an eye on. I'm also not clear if it factors level into the formula instead of Magic Power or in addition to Magic Power.

    Comparing her to Iarumas, I personally think her kit is all around better. Iarumas has a better single target nuke, but Berkanan won't suffer from the same longevity issues and the fact that she gets access to Immortal Strike gives her a self-healing ability that deals damage, which is something mages lack. One thing that will need testing is if True Words of Fire is boosted by Way of the Warrior. Depending on how Way of the Warrior wording is interpreted, it could either boost the spell damage if she casts it on an enemy one row ahead, or it also might not boost it at all of spell damage is not considered close range damage. I'll update this once we're able to verify!
    
    Even though she doesn't have access to Full Power Strike, she does have access to Wild Strike which is a less efficient Major physical attack.

    Like Iarumas, gearing her might be a bit funky as she might want Magic Power if you want to keep True Words of Fire as a potential damage source (assuming it considers class level and Magic Power, not just the former), but she'll also want Attack Power for other skills and basic attacks in her physical kit. Unlike Iarumas, there's no question of how to fit her in on your team. Stick her in front and give her a sword.

    * Pull if:
        * You like Berkanan as an adventurer
        * You want a versatile and overall solid damage dealer
    * Do not pull if:
        * You do not like Berkanan as an adventurer
        * You want to save for future adventurers

## Duplicate Usage:

* Inherit her spell to herself for increased damage
* Discipline for small gains to important stats
* Inherit her spell to the MC or other spellcasters. Having an attack spell that applies two debuffs might situationally be beneficial, especially if you don't want to run multiple mages (excluding Berkanan)
