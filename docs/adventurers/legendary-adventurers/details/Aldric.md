## Adventurer Reviews

??? info "TheAxolotl's Analysis"

    Aldric has the potential to be a solid addition to our legendary adventurer lineup, despite the fact that so many people thought he was going to be a Samurai for some reason. Thank you devs for teasing everyone with your silhouettes. There are quite a few unknowns around his damage scaling, but in general, I personally think Aldric is the first legendary thief that actually looks like they're great at doing what thieves are supposed to do, which is opening chests.

    His damage skill, Blunt Combo Strike, is very unique, but it is also what we're currently least clear on. First, what we do know:
    
    * Both the initial minor attack and the crow attack are impacted by weapon range and surety, as well as Slayer buffs. This likely means they also carry over procs like Corrosion Dagger, Mace of Tumult, and Staff of Weakness.
    * The initial minor attack is not forced to a single hit and instead uses the number of hits provided by the weapon, plus an additional hit for the crow. For example, using a 2-hit weapon, his skill hits a total of 3 times and using a 3-hit weapon, his skill hits a total of 4 times
    * Despite the `Details` page of this skill indicating that there are efficacy increases with higher skill levels, since this is his non-inheritable skill, it is currently locked at level 1, so we can't actually increase its skill level.

    The evade and counter component of this skill is also pretty negligible. While it is boosted by an Alice inherit, it's only actually going to provide damage if he evades something, which means he needs to be attacked by an attack that can be evaded and countered. If this does actually happen, it'll be crow damage, which is nice. Unfortunately, it's not going to be too reliable.

    As far as what we don't know, we really have no idea how the damage of either component scale at higher attack power levels. Since the initial attack on his skill is credited as a `Minor` attack, my suspicion is it'll see its power soft cap at around 300-350 attack power. The crow component on the other hand is different and I suspect behaves more like Sheli's sleepy nuke. More testing needs to be done here, though. I'll update this section as we learn more.

    Moving on to his inheritable skill, Wisdom of the Crafty Old Dwarf is tailored towards being a thief, which is great. That being said, the actual increases are pretty small. On him at skill level 1, it increases his Detect and Evade Trap each by 2 and his Disarm Trap by 5. These are reduced to 1, 1, and 3 respectively when inherited to someone else. The table above will gradually get filled out as we see what the inherited value increases are. The downside of this skill is that it's a pretty low value - on him, it's roughly equivalent to a single Bakesh inherit and a bit over 2 Jean inherits. One someone else, it's roughly equivalent to 1/2 Bakesh and 1 Jean inherit.
    
    His Discipline skill, Adept's Rule of Thumb, is going to be very similar to his inherit in that it'll be improving his disarming abilities at a minor rate. Detect and Disarm Trap are definitely two of the stats that get better value out of Discipline, but it's still going to be a relatively low value per dupe in general.

    The biggest hurdles that Aldric needs to overcome are the fact that he's a thief and the fact that there's already a lot of competition for both rows within a party. Many veteran players stopped using thieves quite a long time ago and have instead made MC or a ninja their disarmer. As such, his value is going to be relatively low for parties with established disarmers. Given the uncertainty at this point around his damage longevity, it's hard to immediately recommend him as a long-term member in a party since thief damage drops off pretty significantly in the later content. That being said, if you want to run a thief, he's going to be the best thief in the game right now at doing a thief's job of disarming traps. If you use a ninja like Rinne as your disarmer instead, inheriting him to her definitely couldn't hurt, but he's also a fairly easy skip.

## Adventurer Pull Plans

??? note "TheAxolotl's Pull Plan"
    I'm likely going to skip him. Maybe I'll get lucky with the free bones, but unless his damage proves to be somehow incredible at higher power levels, I don't see a good way to fit him into my current party. His inherit would be nice to throw on my Rinne, but I don't think the actual value increases are enough for me to want to spend my gems on.
    
## Duplicate Usage

* If you use him, increasing his Discipline is potentially going to be more effective for his disarming capabilities than his inherit is, but not 100% sure on this yet.
* If you don't plan to use him but end up pulling a few copies, might as well give them to your favorite established disarmer.
