## Adventurer Reviews

!!! info "TheAxolotl's Analysis"

    Savia, our first evil knight, is...well, to be blunt, pretty lackluster in my opinion.

    First, to dig into her skills, Black Beast Feint is a very interesting mechanic. It's an evasion self-buff that also acts as a "taunt" with a counter-attack. While at first glance, this seems interesting, there are a few big caveats. First, when I say taunt, I mean the affliction that skills like Attract Hit and Defensive Provike apply, which makes it more likely for an enemy to target a specific adventurer. These afflictions are not a guarantee - they just increase the likelihood of single target attacks going to a specific adventurer.
    
    Second, there is no listed duration for the affliction, so I'm not entirely sure how long it lasts. Attract Hit and Defensive Provoke both last for 3 turns, so I suspect it aligns with that. Regardless of how long that lasts, early reports indicate that the counter attack only happens once per attack received, and only on the turn this is cast. I haven't confirmed this myself, but if that is the case, this would be a very costly skill to maintain, as regardless of how long the affliction lasts, you'll need to use the skill multiple turns in a row to get a single counterattack, and if she happens to get attacked multiple times in one turn, only the first attack receives the counterattack.
    
    In addition, as a Knight, she won't have any innate damage multipliers, such as Way of the Warrior, so even though the counterattack portion has a defense penetration component to it, it's very likely not going to be nearly as powerful as her simply defending and someone else hitting an Opening. It's a very unique skill in general, but I frankly don't see a reason to want to use the skill at all, since that time could be spent performing one of multiple other actions that would overall be more beneficial.

    One thing I'm unclear on is if her Black Beast Feint counter attack counts as a basic attack or a skill. If it is treated as a basic attack, it could have some potential when combined with Follow-Up Attack or if inherited to a Ninja, as it could potentially both help trigger the Ninja attack power boost on evade and critical hits. It could potentially also stack with the Counterattack skill, ultimately resulting in more hits, but this would need to be tested. If the skill is treated as an attack skill, similar to how Abenius' skill is treated, then there is absolutely no value to inheriting it to another adventurer, in my opinion. Some early reports indicate that inheriting Counterattack to Savia conflicts with her skill to the point of neither working as expected, but this behavior will likely get fixed at some point.

    Her Soaring Beast Knight skill likely is similar to Wandering Lana's skill in that the buff is relatively minor at just a few points, and only considers the weapon slot and the chest armor slot.

    Her Discipline skill is also pretty weak - while Evasion is a solid defensive stat, not having any extra offensive boost is less than ideal.

    The timing of her release is also pretty unfortunate - with the Blade and Bastard collaboration coming shortly after, Savia's banner screams "bait banner" to me and should really only be considered by whales.

    * Pull if:
        * You like Savia as an adventurer
        * You want an Evil Beastfolk Knight
        * You are a whale or you want to collect one of every adventurer
    * Do not pull if:
        * You want an adventurer that provides significant value to the party
        * You do not like Savia as an adventurer
        * You want to save for future adventurers or the Blade and Bastard collaboration

    Savia looks cool, but that's really it. While her skill is unique, she doesn't bring anything strong to the party. She's not bad, but there really isn't any compelling reason to use her over other adventurers. She's an easy skip in my opinion.
    
## Duplicate Usage

* Don't pull for duplicates
* If you insist on pulling for duplicates, take your pick between Discipline and skill inheritance. Neither are very compelling.
