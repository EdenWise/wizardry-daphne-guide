# TheAxolotl's Disclaimer

When I'm filling out my party and evaluating adventurers is that I always ask "What can this adventurer bring to the party that is unique?" Yeka brings ambush prevention, bind resistance, and (when it gets fixed) bonus damage to undead. Lana brings a row-wide damage boost and a post-battle heal. Alice brings a row-wide damage boost and increased turn duration on buffs/debuffs.

Gerard, Gerulf, and Adam, while all very strong, don't bring anything unique to me outside of raw damage. Adam's dampening is great, but I think it's more a quality of life gain rather than a true damage potential boost, especially when he can inherit multiple types to hit weaknesses.

Debra, while also great, doesn't bring anything super unique. Her SP recovery was excellent early on, but it's definitely a bit less relevant to me now that she's 50 since thieves have such a high SP pool to begin with. I currently round out my party with Debra and Adam, but both of them feel more replaceable to me than Lana, Yeka, and Alice.
