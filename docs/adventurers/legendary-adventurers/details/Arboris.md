## Adventurer Reviews

!!! info "TheAxolotl's Analysis"

    Arboris is our very first limited legendary thief and he is currently broken. I don't mean that in a good way, as there is some really funky behavior going on with his skills.

    First, neither `Lord of the Deep Forest's` nor `Astral Break` seem to actually be changing turn order when applied as expected. It's possible that this is due to the mechanics of how turn order is calculated based on action speed, but it's also possible that it's bugged.

    Second, `Astral Break` is currently bugged with multi-hit weapons and can result in acting as a buff purge for both the user and the party member in front or behind. I'll get to the why in a bit as I talk about the skills themselves.

    `Astral Break` is a major attack skill, which is great. It hits hard and provides a solid damage option for thieves. It's very costly SP-wise, at 20 SP for level 1, and being an elf, he already has a smaller SP pool than Debra, who is going to be his most common competitor. The actions speed buff counts as a buff like you would expect, so it is subject to the 3 buff limit. The issue comes in when it actually knocks buffs off the stack. This is likely a bug, but every hit that this still lands counts as a buff being applied. So if you use this skill with a 1-hit weapon, it gets treated as applying 1 buff, which is expected. If you use this skill with a 2-hit or a 3-hit weapon, it gets treated as applying 2 or 3 buffs respectively, however it only actually applies a single buff icon. This is very problematic, as if you have a buff combination of something like `MACALDIA` and `Warrior's Battle Cry`, using this skill while being in front of or behind the adventurer with three buffs will cause 2 (or all 3 with Cuisinart) buffs to be removed and replaced with a single action speed buff.

    `Lord of the Deep Forest's`, outside of being grammatically weird, at a glance seems like solid evil and neutral support, however it also has some issues. First and foremost is that for the two skills being buffed, it is very hard to evaluate the effectiveness of the buffs. It is a Synergy that behaves similar to Rinne's Surety boost, always applying to him and extending to others that meet the criteria. Since it is a Synergy, that means we are unable to see the exact amount being modified, so it's a bit of a guess to know if it's even providing value.

    I'm generally not a big fan of Discipline skills to begin with, so this will be short - in general, `King's Disposition` is absolute garbage as far as Discipline goes.

    Assuming they fix his bugs, I'm still not very impressed with `Lord of the Deep Forest's`. My big issue with it is that I find the buffs it provides to be contradictory. The evasion boost will be appreciated most by the front row, yet you generally don't want your front row to outspeed your back row, since optimal speed tuning has your buffers and debuffers going before your damage dealers. Similarly, your mages and priests will benefit most from the action speed boost, however they'll benefit least from the evasion boost. In general, having conditional in-battle action speed adjustments can really mess with optimized speed tuning in your equipment. If you want to really mess with speed turning during a battle, just use `BATILGREF` and `PORTO`.

    * Pull if:
        * You like Arboris as an adventurer
        * You want a thief to be able to hit water content hard
    * Do not pull if:
        * You do not like Arboris as an adventurer
        * You want to wait to see how or if his bugs get fixed
        * You don't want to mess with conditional in-battle speed tuning
        * You want to save for future, more impactful adventurers
    
## Duplicate Usage

* Increase the efficacy of his Astral Break
* Discipline to get very minor stat boosts
