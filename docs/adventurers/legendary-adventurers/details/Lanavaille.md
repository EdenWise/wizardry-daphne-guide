## Duplicate Usage:

1. If you use her Wandering Princess style, inherit her standard style to her own skill to increase its healing power.
2. If you use her standard style and not her Wandering Princess style, Discipline is always a good choice.
3. Inherit her skill to the MC.
4. Save for future use. It's possible that she'll end up becoming a good candidate in the future to dismiss for Grade tags.
