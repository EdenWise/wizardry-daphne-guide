## Adventurer Reviews

??? info "TheAxolotl's Analysis"

    Our second legendary Ninja is quite powerful, but there are a few things to keep in mind. We'll start with her kit.

    Thousand Hue Blossom is a very potent signature attack. Think of this as a better Wild Throw, which can hit a single target multiple times. This gives it great use as both single and multi target scenarios. Early testing shows that an inherited level 3 Hue is roughly equivalent in damage to a level 5 Heavy Attack, which makes this quite potent both when used on her and inherited. The Charm aspect can also be convenient, but it's nothing absolutely game breaking at the moment.

    Her passive, Foxfire Assault, provides a debuff to enemies she hits during the first 3 turns that increases damage dealt to them by the party by roughly 5%. The debuff lasts for 1 turn and is subject to extension from Alice inherits, so definitely give her some of those! Since it is a debuff, be mindful of the 3 debuff limit during those first turns. The duration is 1 turn by default, so even though she can only trigger it during the first three turns, Alice inherits will take that to 4 or 5 turns respectively. Keep in mind that this is enemy turns and not her turns, so enemies that perform two consecutive actions will have this duration shortened.

    Her Discipline, Pinnacle of the FLower District, is a welcome Attack Power and SP boost, which is always welcome.

    The biggest question people will have is around how she compares to Rinne and if she's worth pulling for. Compared to Rinne, she should be consistently doing higher single target damage, which is something that Ninjas currently struggle in. If you want to pick one to run, Yuzu is going to likely be the stronger one. That being said, nothing should stop you from running both, as they are very exceptional adventurers.

    The big thing to keep in mind with pulling for her is that we have a new class coming soon. Yes, she's strong, but she's released at a time where the meta is 2h weapons with Strength+ and we have no idea what the new class is going to bring to the table. Consider those factors before making your choice!

## Adventurer Pull Plans

??? note "TheAxolotl's Pull Plan"

    I pulled multiple copies because despite the current meta, I'm a fan of Ninjas, as well as her damage + utility combination and her aesthetic.

## Duplicate Usage

* Inherit on her own skill will increase its effectiveness.
* Inherit to another adventurer if you need to give them a solid active skill.
* Increasing her Discipline to increase her Attack Power and SP.
