## Adventurer Reviews

!!! info "TheAxolotl's Analysis"

    Adam provides very consistent damage and longevity for a mage due to his two unique skills. Reducing the dampening of damage means he's not as impacted when fighting enemies that are strong against Light damage. His main downside is that he innately only can deal Light damage. This can be offset by inheriting some single target spells that deal other elements of damage, however without the inheritance, he will only have an elemental advantage against enemies weak to light.

    Changing his class to Priest will give him a wider selection of spells, as well, making him a very well-rounded Adventurer for support or damage purposes.

    His inheritable unique skill gets an extra nod in that if it is inherited by another character, that character will receive the full bonus of the damage dampening. This has some nice quality of life potential to boost the damage dealt by the MC (or your favorite damage dealers) against unfavorable element type matchups when they weild elemental weapons. Note that this skill does not have any impact on Undead or Entity resistance to non-spell attacks.

    Compared to Yekaterina, his damage will generally be more consistent, and he will be able to cast more spells overall, however he will be missing out on the bonus damage to undead and multiple innate elemental type coverages. This can be overcome by inheriting other spells on him to give him additional elemental coverage. Early game, the extra longevity will be nice, but will become less relevant as MP pools get higher and MP potions become obtainable. Still, he's an excellent pull and you have many options for spending his duplicates.
