## Adventurer Reviews

!!! info "TheAxolotl's Analysis"
    
    Debra is our first Legendary thief, and she is great at it. She can deal strong damage for a thief, particularly later on when you have both Hiding and Sneak Attack unlocked. Her skills also allow her to regularly use Precision Strike to kill enemies for a net 0 SP use. When fighting bosses, her debuffs can be very helpful, with an extra nod to Delay Attack.

    That being said, it's very likely that other thieves might be released in the future that end up providing more damage or utility than she does. Her SP restoration becomes less crucial as she gets higher up in levels, as well, due to the high SP pool that Thieves have. She's extremely helpful to have now, but it's hard to say if she'll remain strong in the future.

    If you inherit her skill to other Adventurers, the restore amount will be cut in half, with skill level 1 returning 2 SP instead of 4.

## Duplicate Usage

* If you use her, increasing her Discipline will increase her damage, while inheriting her skill to herself will increase the SP restore amount
* Inherit her skill on your MC (or other physical damage dealers) for the SP restore
* Save for future use. It's possible that she'll end up becoming a good candidate in the future to dismiss for Grade tags.
