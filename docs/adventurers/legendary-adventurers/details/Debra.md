## Duplicate Usage:

1. If you use her, increasing her Discipline will increase her damage.
2. Inheriting her skill on your MC (or other physical damage dealers) can help them out a bit. At skill level 1, the SP restore is minimal (2 sp per kill) but the inheritance value will go up as that inherited skill level increases.
3. Save for future use. It's possible that she'll end up becoming a good candidate in the future to dismiss for Grade tags.
