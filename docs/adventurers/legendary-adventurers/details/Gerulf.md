## Adventurer Reviews

!!! info "TheAxolotl's Analysis"

    Gerulf does one thing and one thing well. He hits hard with a 2h mace. If you're not using him with a 2h mace, he's not living up to his full potential. Unfortunately, there are some things that work against him right now. Since he's evil, he will actually hinder a party that uses Lanavaille, as both of them want to be in the front row and having them both there will negate Lanavaille's row buff. This likely won't be a permanent limitation, though, since in the future we should be able to build a strong Neutral/Evil front row.

    You can get around this by putting him in the back row with a spear, but that will limit the effectiveness of Eruption Strike.

    One other thing going against him is that the Port Town Grand Legion is full of water enemies, including the bosses, which will increase the damage he takes and reduce his Eruption Strike damage unless you inherit Adam to him.

## Duplicate Usage

* Inherit on his own skill will increase the damage and cost of his Eruption Strike.
* Once his Eruption Strike is maxed out, increase his Discipline to increase his damage further.
* Save for future use or dismiss for Grade tags.
