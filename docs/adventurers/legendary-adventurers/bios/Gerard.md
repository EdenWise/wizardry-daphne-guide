Moderate wind type physical attack on 1 enemy. Low chance of inflicting Paralysis on target. Damage is reduced if learned by someone other than Gerard.

Increases Evasion when equipped with a one-handed sword.

### Discipline Skill: Thundersmiter's Protection

Continuously increases each stat, Evasion and Action Speed increased further.

## Duplicate Usage:

1. If you use him, Discipline will increase his speed and evasion, which are both great skills to boost.
2. Inherit on his own skill will increase the damage and cost of his Thunderstrike.
3. Save for future use. He is also a current candidate to dismiss for Grade tags, although if you're going to dismiss him, why spend the resources to pull on him to begin with?
