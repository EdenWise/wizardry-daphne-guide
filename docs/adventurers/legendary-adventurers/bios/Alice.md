## Skills

### Unique Skill (Inheritable): Blessing of Agora

Adds 1 consecutive turn to buffs and debuffs applied by the user and increases MP. MP increase amount and growth amount of consecutive turns are reduced if learned by someone other than Alice.

**NOTE: There is potentially a bug with this skill. It currently boosts the turn duration for buffs and debuffs that cost MP, however it does not boost the duration of buffs/debuffs that cost SP**

### Unique Skill (Not Inheritable): Agent of Heresy

Increases damage to enemies for everyone in a row if it has only evil or neutral allies.

### Discipline Skill: Ira's Divine Protection

Continuously increases Divine Power.

## Duplicate Usage:

1. Inherit her skill on other buffers/debuffers you use. Note that this should include any damage dealers that have self-buffing or boss-debuffing capabilities. See note above for potential bug.
2. If you plan to use Alice (you should), increasing her Discipline will increase her damage and healing.
3. Save for future use.
