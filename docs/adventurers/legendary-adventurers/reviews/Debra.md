# Debra

## TheAxolotl's Analysis:

Debra is our first Legendary thief, and she is great at it. She can deal strong damage for a thief, particularly later on when you have both Hiding and Sneak Attack unlocked. Her skills also allow her to regularly use Precision Strike to kill enemies for a net 0 SP use. When fighting bosses, her debuffs can be very helpful, with an extra nod to Delay Attack.

That being said, it's very likely that other thieves might be released in the future that end up powercreeping her, and a thief MC could very well end up actually being better at being a thief than she is. She's extremely helpful to have now, but it's hard to say if she'll remain strong in the future. One extra note is that inheriting Debra's skill on other characters at very high levels can restore large amounts of SP upon kill.
