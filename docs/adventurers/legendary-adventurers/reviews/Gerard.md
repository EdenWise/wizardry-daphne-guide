# Gerard

## TheAxolotl's Analysis:

I'll preface this with the fact that I did not pull on Gerard, so these are my thoughts on his kit as opposed to his performance. By all means, I welcome the analysis of someone who has him and has used him.

Gerard strikes me as a bit of a hybrid between Lanavaille and Gerulf, as he is a Knight that is focused more on damage and evasion than full protection. His unique skill is an attack that presumably has a similar damage modifier to Gerulf's with an added bonus of having a chance to inflict paralysis. The thing that strikes me as odd, though, is the fact that he's evasion-focused, yet the standard Knight skills tend to benefit from higher Defense Power. To get higher evasion, you'll usually be wearing lighter armor which by default will have lower Defense Power than heavier armor. That's not a bad thing in itself, but it does make me think you'd have to either spread your stat emphasis across too many values or ignore some element of his kit to really optimize him during use. Since his unique skill is an attack, I would favor gearing similarly to the MC or a thief, and treating him like a fighter.

Since he has a Good personality, he would fit well on the front line with Lana and be able to receive her personality damage boost, so that could let him go toe-to-toe with Gerulf from a damage perspective while similarly being a bit less of a glass cannon due to being able to use Thunderstrike with a 1h and Shield combination.

I don't believe Gerard is bad by any means, but I think he's a bit less compelling to use than a front-line Debra, despite the fact that he'd likely live longer if hit and deal more overall damage.
