Adam's homeland was in the highlands of the northern mountains. With few blessings of the weather, neither crop nor beast thrived. The family lived in this impoverished land.

His ancestors had chosen to live ascetically here after receiving a revelation from God, but whenever Adam or his brother interacted with elves living elsewhere, the poverty of their lives was made plain, and this pained them.

When northern elves reach the age of 100, they begin to interact with elves other clans. As part of this, Adam also began visiting other elven realms along the mountain range in to learn magic. While studying on these
excursions, Adam heard rumors of a mysterious place in the highlands.

-The Millennial Lord; the wielder of great spells that could return fertility to barren lands. In this mage's hands, lush greenery grew in abundance, be it is desert or mountaintop. With this magic, he created the Millennium Lands.

"If such magic really exists, my homeland could also be a lush, green place. It would make everyone's life so much easier."

He gathered allies to search for the Millennial Lands. It took centuries for them to finally locate it.
Protected by a powerful barrier, no one could find the land for a long time, but through their map-making, they uncovered a region they could not enter.

Adam and his companions carefully studied the structure of the Millennial Land's wards, unraveled the intricately-woven seal, and made their way in.

True to the legends, the Millennial Lands were a place of verdant greenery even though they were higher up the mountains than even Adam's own home. But, there were no animals and no prosperity to be seen. As they investigated, Adam found a fine throne made of stone in the center of the lands. There on the throne, in a weary pose, sat a desiccated humanoid skeleton, like a withered tree, adorned with a crown.

"This crown. Are these the remains of the mage of these verdant lands, the Millennial Lord?"

Adam touched the crown. Instantly, a torrent of knowledge flowed into him like a raging stream. It was the Millennial Lord's knowledge, his spells, his very will. Overcome by these memories, when Adam came to, he was no longer Adam.

"I am the Millennial Lord. You who desired my secret art; as reward for reviving me, I give you the Millennial Lands."

Saying this, Adam then slew his stunned companions. As if in response, greenery thickened and flowers bloomed.

This mage of calamity created fertile lands by exchanging the life forces of living creatures. By the time the Millennial Lord's true self became clear, it was already too late. There was no one who could stop the Millennial Lord who had stolen Adam's body.

"Yes, here is your reward. Do take it."

Having become the Millennial Lord, Adam returned to his homeland and slaughtered his clan.

Noticing something odd, neighboring elves journeyed to the highlands and discovered piles of elven corpses and a land overwhelmed by lush greenery. Adam alone stood in the midst of the carnage, looking quite pleased with himself.  When the neighboring elves called out to him, he slew and left. He was then hunted as a murderer.

Now that Adam’s innately talented body was host to an unimaginable amount of knowledge and spells that even the longest-lived elves could not hope to achieve, there was no one who could stop the Millennial Lord who had taken his body.

Adam slew all the elves pursuing him, and anyone he met along the way, and continued to revitalize the barren land into lush green places.

Time passed, long enough for a new generation of elves to emerge.

Deep in the woods, where there were neither the song of birds to the footsteps of animals, they discovered Adam’s desiccated remains, seated upon a throne. However, none would touch the body, for an inscription on the side of the throne read “None soever may touch of this body.”

– The one who touches this body will have their body stolen by the Millennial Lord and become a murderer. The Millennial Lord is a guardian deity of greenery, inflicting disaster upon mortals. I defied the will of the Millennium Lord, reached these lands, and ended my life. But my sins shall never disappear. –

The people agreed to seal Adam within all the lands and burying him away from the world along with the record of his existence.

Ironically, the realm that had once been a wasteland had become a llush, verdant land by the passage of Millennial Lord Adam, to the realm’s prosperity.
