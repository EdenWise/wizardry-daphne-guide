Adam's homeland was in the highlands of the northern mountains. With few blessings of the weather, neither crop nor beast thrived. The family lived in this impoverished land.

His ancestors had chosen to live ascetically here after receiving a revelation from God, but whenever Adam or his brother interacted with elves living elsewhere, the poverty of their lives was made plain, and this pained them.

When northern elves reach the age of 100, they begin to interact with elves other clans. As part of this, Adam also began visiting other elven realms along the mountain range in to learn magic. While studying on these
excursions, Adam heard rumors of a mysterious place in the highlands.

-The Millennial Lord; the wielder of great spells that could return fertility to barren lands. In this mage's hands, lush greenery grew in abundance, be it is desert or mountaintop. With this magic, he created the Millennium Lands.

"If such magic really exists, my homeland could also be a lush, green place. It would make everyone's life so much easier."

He gathered allies to search for the Millennial Lands. It took centuries for them to finally locate it.
Protected by a powerful barrier, no one could find the land for a long time, but through their map-making, they uncovered a region they could not enter.

Adam and his companions carefully studied the structure of the Millennial Land's wards, unraveled the intricately-woven seal, and made their way in.

True to the legends, the Millennial Lands were a place of verdant greenery even though they were higher up the mountains than even Adam's own home. But, there were no animals and no prosperity to be seen. As they investigated, Adam found a fine throne made of stone in the center of the lands. There on the throne, in a weary pose, sat a desiccated humanoid skeleton, like a withered tree, adorned with a crown.

"This crown. Are these the remains of the mage of these verdant lands, the Millennial Lord?"

Adam touched the crown. Instantly, a torrent of knowledge flowed into him like a raging stream. It was the Millennial Lord's knowledge, his spells, his very will. Overcome by these memories, when Adam came to, he was no longer Adam.

"I am the Millennial Lord. You who desired my secret art; as reward for reviving me, I give you the Millennial Lands."

Saying this, Adam then slew his stunned companions. As if in response, greenery thickened and flowers bloomed.

This mage of calamity created fertile lands by exchanging the life forces of living creatures. By the time the Millennial Lord's true self became clear, it was already too late. There was no one who could stop the Millennial Lord who had stolen Adam's body.

"Yes, here is your reward. Do take it."
