Debra was born on a small island populated entirely by beastfolk. The island was called the beastfolk paradise. But after slave traders invaded the island and took control, it became a hell for the beastfolk. Debra was a slave-child from birth.

Beastfolk children were raised by their mothers for a time, but when they are old enough to have their quality judged by their looks, they are priced and separated from their parents. Seeing Debra grow more lovely every day, her parents began to feel both joy and despair.

Debra's parents were very strict with her about staying out of sight, even having her wear a hood and mask. They made it known to those around them that disease had left her with sores.

Even so, they knew they could not do this forever. They decided they had to flee from the island with Debra.

With the help of some friends, Debra's parents hid a boat under a precarious cliff and began counting down the days until their planned escape.

On a stormy, moonless night, the three attempted to escape the island. But their plan had somehow reached the slave traders' ears. Realizing that they were cut off, her parents lured the slavers away and allowed only Debra to escape, telling her "No matter what happens, never kill out of hate."

The next day, Debra's parents were executed as a warning. "Do not kill" became her parent's last words to her. Out of grief and anger, Debra began to retaliate against the humans in ways other than murder.

She stole things from the slave trader's and distributed it among the beastfolk, helping those who wanted to escape from the island. And with this, the slave trader's anger and hatred toward Debra grew by the day.

Debra's reputation among the island's beastfolk grew by the day. But while grew, Debra's mind was never at rest.

No matter how much Debra retaliated against the humans, they would not leave, and instead more and more beastfolk were made to suffer, as if in retribution.

The humans would stop at nothing to capture Debra. They put up a guillotine in the main square and declared they would kill beastfolk one by one until she turned herself in.

The first beastfolk shouted for her to stay away before their head rolled off the platform. The second cried for her to leave the island before their head rolled off the platform. The third demanded that she destroy the island before their head, too, rolled off the platform.

Just before the execution of the fourth, Debra appeared.

The slave traders cheered wildly and seized her. They stripped her, removed her mask, and forced her to stand at the guillotine for all to see.

They had intended to humiliate and disgrace her before her execution, but beneath her mask and hood Debra was like a beautiful goddess. The moment they saw her beauty, both slaver and beastfolk, were left speechless.

Ever eager for coin, the slave traders began fighting amongst themselves when they realized that Debra was an exquisite beastfolk that would fetch a high price.

One drew a sword, prompting the others to do the same. In the commotion of the slave traders killing each other, Debra managed to slip away.

Soon after Debra disappeared from the execution site, a deep rumbling echoed through the island, and fire
erupted from the volcano in the center of the island.

The island slowly sank and the slavers fled the island in a panic. The beastfolk, too, fled the island, one by one, from the harbor abandoned by the traders, clinging in boats or logs.

"The island of the beastfolk had the blessing of the beastfolk god. And Debra was a herald. It must be so."
So the beastfolk thought, and the story of Debra the Skull, the noble outlaw, would be told among the surviving beastfolk.

The beastfolk continued to fight discrimination on the continent, but with Debra's help from the shadows, they felt the blessing of the island goddess on the continent as well.

Debra's legend continues to give hope to all beastfolk until the day they become truly free.
