Rinne's most ancient memory is of a great hand conveying her into darkness--

In the Eastern nations, there is a village of shinobi concealed within the deep mountains. Therewithin dwells a clan who serve a certain estate, who possess every technique that can take a life; terminating without a sound.

Rinne was a simple elven girl who was carried away and brought there. The clan head and village leader  set his sights on the long-lived elves that he might instill into living flesh and blood the secret arts passed down through the clan that cannot be committed to writing.

The training that the young Rinne was forced to undergo was harsh. She was left upon a mountain, told to return alive, and thrown to wild dogs, told to "vanish".

The girl, wounded throughout her body, unwaveringly mastered the skills of the shinobi.
