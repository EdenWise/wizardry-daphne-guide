It was an ancient time, before it was even certain what name the continent even went by... There was another continent far away from there.

A magical hole suddenly appeared in the continent, filled to the brim with monsters and treasure, as well as traps. There was an adventurer called **** who ventured into the dungeon. **** and his companions continued to take on the dungeon. Burned, decapitated, petrified, level-drained--he'd died many times. And each time he had returned from the underworld to challenge the dungeon once more.

He had his own reason for being so obsessed with the dungeon. In the dungeon there exists a master of the dungeon. That master possessed an amulet which held limitless magical power. **** felt a powerful desire to kill the master of the dungeon and seize the amulet.

Just when was it that it happened? At the end of his adventure, **** came face to face with an old mage who was exuding a thick magical energy. This mage held an amulet that shone with pale white brilliance. **** understood instinctively. He needed to get his hands on it. It was why the man was still here.

"****!!!"

Someone was calling the man's name. In answer to that voice, he closed in on the old mage, his katana held tight. But **** lost his battle with the old mage. His consciousness once again fell into the darkness of death.

How much time had passed since then? **** was resurrected at the temple and was returned to the world. However, he had lost his memories, perhaps because of how long it took for him to be resurrected.
