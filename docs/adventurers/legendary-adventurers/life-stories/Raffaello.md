Raffaello was born and raised within the hallowed halls of the Grand Temple of Fidelis, a place steeped in centuries of tradition. By the time he came of age, he had devoted himself to the gods and become one of the devout faithful.

Life at the temple was full of pious faith and boundless compassion. At the same time, nonbelievers were subjected to harsh inquisitions. The sight of it all held no fear for Raffaello. Nor did he feel pity for the heretic. He simply understood that insisting on one's own way within the group would lead to nothing but harm. Raffaello carried himself with polite grace, striving always to earn the favor of all, and he applied himself to his studies with tireless diligence.

In the years of his youth, he found his heart captivated by Evelyn, a woman five years his senior. She became his world, his everything. Years later, they exchanged vows in matrimony.

"It pleases me greatly, Evelyn, that you are my wife."

So spoke Raffaello, a gentle smile upon his face.

Evelyn, the woman Raffaello took as his wife, was as merciful as a goddess and beloved by all. Raffaello could not help but wonder. Why did his wife direct that beautiful smile at anyone other than him? Raffaello's possessiveness, little by little, became tinged with a growing madness he could not contain.

"My beloved Evelyn is my world-my everything."

"She must be made to feel the same of me. I must guide her rightly."

Whenever Evelyn defied his teachings, Raffaello would brand her in places normally hidden beneath her clothing. He struck her until bruises formed. He cut her hair and tore her nails. And yet, as long as she remained faithful to his teachings, he adored Evelyn to a fanatical degree.

Evelyn, ever obedient, believed that her husband would guide her through her shortcomings as a devout member of the faithful, and she endured his punishments, and eventually lost her life.

Raffaello resurrected Evelyn, who had died from his punishments, and whenever she broke his teachings, he repeated the punishments until she died yet again. To Raffaello, these were trials meant to lead his wife onto the righteous path. But then it happened: resurrection did not occur, and Evelyn's body crumbled to ash. Raffaello was overcome with sorrow from the depths of his heart, and he rapidly wasted away. With tears in his eyes, he told the others that she was a brave woman who had succumbed to a long and tragic illness. He was so trusted by the faithful that there were none among them who questioned him.

Raffaello, drifting through hollow days, one day heard tales of alchemy from a passing traveler. It was a secret art capable of bringing forth new substances from base materials. Upon hearing the tale, a revelation struck Raffaello, descending upon him like a gift from the heavens.

"With the right materials, perhaps even she, vanished though she is, might be called back into the world of the living."

"Ahhh, Evelyn! Evelyn, Evelyn, Evelyn. Wait for me.
