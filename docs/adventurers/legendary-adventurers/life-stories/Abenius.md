Abenius was once a lovely young girl called Anne Owen. She was born in the western lands of House Owen, the youngest daughter with five older brothers, to the lord and lady of the house.

The lands of House Owen where she lived were fertile. It had a bountiful river that brought abundant blessings and a mild climate. However, these things also made it an easy target for monster invasions. Defense of the territory was the responsibility of House Owen.

Her five brothers had wielded swords from an early age and were always ready for battle. All except Anne, the one and only girl.

Ann weaved a crown of flowers with a smile.
"Fear not, my brothers. The guardian of Owen is on our side."
Anne's reasons for her certainty were well-founded. The blessing of a guardian statue had protected House Owen for generations.

The guardian statue of House Owen, modeled after a holy matriarch, was said to shed tears in times of crisis, giving one of the members of the house inhuman powers to defend the land.

It was a legend known to all of House Owen, but Anne's father, the lord, was not fool enough to be comforted by such fables. He put together an army of his own and protected his people with much consideration.

But then things drastically changed. Lizardmen had built a lair along the bank of a great river known as Owen's Bounty. To make matters worse, a flock of harpies had also flown in. Owen's lands were expoused to attacks on multiple fronts.

Anne's father drove them off many times, but the onslaught finally brought him to his knees. Ann clung to her father, then cold in his coffin. What would become of Owen? Before all thoose in attendance, unable to conceal their astonishment, a body of faint white light drifted up from the coffin... It was drawn into the guardian statue and became tears.

The tears shed by the guardian statue of Owen gave off a light that settled upon Anne's eldest brother. "He's been chosen," somebody whispered in astonishment. The eldest brother's swordsmanship, now imbued with power, surpassed that of his father, who was said to be a valiant captain. He once destroyed a large contingent of the enemy, but at the end of a back-and-forth battle, he finally fell to the fangs of the lizardmen.

Once again, the power of the guardian statue's tears flowed forth, engendered unto the second son. The second son, awakened to his abilities, also twice repelled the monsters onslaught. Though he fought faliantly, the talons of a harpy tore across his back.

And thus the guardian statue wept for a third time. In the light of the waning sun, the tears seemed as blood, like agonized cries for the dearth of victory.

The three surviving brothers cried out to the guardian statue.
"Grant us power! Grant the power to defend the people!"

Yet the guardian light fell not on them, but on the youngest daughter, Anne.

Anne's illumination by the light of the blessing confounded those around her, thinking that it was some kind of mistake. Ann herself was more surprised than any other.

She clung to her mother's lap in fear, but her mother only glanced down dispassionately.
"You are the next to be chosen. Take your sword and make your stand on the battlefield."

Anne was sent to the front, not knowing how such a thing could have come to pass. Her hands trembled as she held her sword and her armor weighed heavily on her. The host of monsters fell upon her without mercy.

In that instant, Anne's blade flashed across the enemy's body. With a single stroke, it tore through the hard skin of a lizardman and pierced the thick feathers of a harpy. Before she knew it, she was making her way across the battlefield, leaving nothing but the silent corpses of monsters in her wake. Though she had never held a sword before, she was somehow deft with every swing. Her limbs were as light as if they had gained wings.

Anne's fear evaporated as the inexhaustible power surged through her. She had to protect her beloved family.

Thus Anne became the guardian of Owen. The morning sun shone upon Owen, who were told they would never see dawn again. Her sword, catching the light, was a true flash.

Anne returned home, her cheeks flush and her breath ragged. She looked forward to seeing her brothers' happy faces and her mother's warm embrace. But what awaited her when was not a warm family, but a cold allegiance.
"We rejoice in your return. O, Guardian of Owen."
"You are granted a new name. Please carry on the name of Abenius the Guardian."
With that, the girl known as Anne was no more, and the guardian of Owen, Abenius the Glintblade, was born.

Abenius was remembered in the annals of Owen as a peerless warrior who vanquished more enemies than any other and brought lasting peace.
