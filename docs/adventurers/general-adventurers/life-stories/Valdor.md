Valdor is from the village of Eld in the northwesternregion of the continent. The village was located near a mine that produced valuable minerals and was home to around 100 dwarves.

Valdor's father worked as a blacksmith in the village. To a blacksmith, fire is crucial, as it determines the quality of a blade. Valdor's family also venerated fire as a deity, believing deeply, fearing and worshipping it. Having been brought up in such an environment, faith in this deity was quite heated.

One day, a skirmish broke out between two dukes who ruled lands near the village. Both duchies approached the dwarves with large orders for their high-quality weapons.

However, as the war dragged on, in an attempt to keep their enemies from obtaining the dwarves' fine weapons, the humans began sending soldiers to the village to capture and kill the blacksmiths.
