In dwarven territory southeast of the capital, Eckart was born the second son of a knight. His family had resided there for generations, and the area was abundant in precious metals.

Since the mines held great riches, surrounding lords targeted them many times. Each time, it was the lord and his knights that came to the defense of the land and the citizens. It was just as Lord Barnabas would say, "Lords and knights are there to protect the land and the people."

After apprenticing, Eckardt himself swore the oath to his lord to protect the land and was formally knighted.

Twenty years later, however, tragedy befell the realm. Lord Barnabas died in an accident during a visit to the mines.

He came to be succeeded by a distant relative, Fritz. The new, 20-year-old lord brought with him companions from his homeland.

The retainers initially watched over their new lord and his close-knit circle, as they seemed uneasy in unfamiliar territory. However, governors came to oppose the way the lord handled matters only amongst his companions. Dwarven unity, rooted in the land, is strong. As so, they implored him not to neglect the old retainers.

However, those retainers who complained were removed from their posts, and before long, all key posts were occupied by companions of Fritz.

Eckart resented his new lord but kept his frustrations to himself for the sake of protecting the land.

In autumn, the territory's largest festival takes place. During this festival of gratitude, the lord prays in the mines, sees the miner's flagons are kept full, and partakes in song and dance. The new lord, however, called the festival off.

Ready to face punishment, some citizens rushed to the lord's manor to try to change his mind. They explained that the festival was to thank the gods for bringing safety to the mines, and that it is the duty of the lord to carry it through.

After listening to their please, Lord Fritz gave an order to his knights. "Behead these people." Eckart, who was closest by, was completely taken aback and refused. But Fritz shouted that a knight must obey their liege.

Hearing these words, Eckart lunged forward to strike Lord Fritz down.

But Eckart failed to bring down Lord Fritz, as his companions swiftly stopped the attack. Unable to eliminate Fritz's faction, Eckert fled the territory.

The day he was knighted, Eckert swore to protect the land. That is when the former lord, Barnabas, said to him, "Lords and knights are there to protect the land and the people." Eckart could not serve a lord who harmed his subjects.

He earned a living by escorting traveling merchants, and lived off what he made working at the Adventurer's Guild in the royal capital. He surmised that since the royal capital saw so many people coming and going, he'd eventually come across information on his homeland.

Eckert never abandoned his pride as a knight. He dreamed of the day when the lord was replaced and he could return to his homeland.
