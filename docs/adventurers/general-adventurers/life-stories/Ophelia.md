Ophelia was born in a small mountain village in the south of the continent. She was the eldest of five children, with two brothers and two sisters.

Her parents, who still as close as newlyweds, were always busy working to put food on the table for their five children. From an early age Ophelia helped her parents with the cooking, cleaning, babysitting, and other chores.

Having always felt loved by her wonderful parents, Ophelia thought that if she were to marry, she'd want what her parents had.

Then tragedy struck when Ophelia was just 10 years old. While gathering firewood in the forest, her brothers, who had been playing by throwing stones, ended up wounding a wild boar in some bushes, angering it.

The squealing of its cubs at one point distracted the boar and so Ophelia was able to escape its wrath, but both her brothers died from wounds inflicted by the boar's tusks.

The young family grieved the terrible loss of their precious sons. As their big sister, Ophelia regretted being unable to protect them and she decided then that, in order to protect her family, she would replace her brothers by becoming a force second to none.

From then on, she started taking on the heavy tasks of hunting, worked the fields, and chopping wood. All that physical training made the petite Ophelia stronger, and before long she had grown into a capable warrior.

When her sisters were no long able to help her, Ophelia's parents started to search for a suitable match for her, as she was now old enough.

But Ophelia, her body covered in scars, had been wielding her sword in place of her two deceased brothers.

The young men of the village respected her, but also kept their distance.

Ophelia's bravery was well known in the village, she left the men speechless and none would be her suitor.

It hurt Ophelia to see her parent's distress at this, and to know that her remaining at home, never a bride, and no prospect for a groom, would also hinder her sisters in finding suitors. Considering her predicament, Ophelia decided to leave home and join the guild of a large nearby town.

Though her parents were reluctant, Ophelia set off, thinking she might meet a man stronger than herself and therefore appease her family.

Dexterous and good-natured, Ophelia whipped up camp's meals and saw that everyone was well-fed. While she appreciated her companions, the strong suitor she was after would prove quite elusive.
