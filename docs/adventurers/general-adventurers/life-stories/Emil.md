Emil was a pious and exemplary elven priest. He grew up in a thriving spellcasting town near the southern port, a town where many mages from the outside world came to learn, which was rare for elven communities as they were said to be insular.

However, it was said that a priest need only have strong faith, so believing in his god's divinity, Emil spent his days praying without having any close interaction with others.

One day, Emil's childhood friend Dino came to visit him. Dino, who'd become a renowned mage, told Emil that he had decided to leave town.

A mage, Dino had spent 200 years researching spells in their town, felt that he had learned all he could there, and decided to go to the capital and acquire new knowledge.

Emil's inquisitive friend spot of his interests beyond the town. Everything Emil heard was new to him, but at the same time, having only ever known the town, he found it all hard to believe.

"Do you seriously intend to spend hundreds of years of your life praying to God in this place, Emil? Itseems you're truly not interested in the world."

Feeling that Dino was saying that he lacked understanding, for the first time ever, he felt shame over his indifference. When Emil asked Dino about the significance of exploring the outside, Dino smirked and replied.

"You will find out that no god exists in this world."

Then Dino spoke of how hell had appeared in the land, of the Abyss. The more Emil heard, the more doubt arose in his mind.

According to the teachings, God's majesty is supposed to reach through out the world. Emil wondered how this Abyss, a place where neither natural laws nor God's teachings have held sway, could exist.

Emil had never left his town, and never thought about anything outside of the town, let alone the Abyss. He realized how content he had been with merely praying and not trying to know more.

He concluded that the doubts he had regarding the Abyss meant that he needed to verify things with his own eyes.

And so, Emil set out on his journey.

His childhood friend said they wanted to know more about the Abyss. As a traveling priest, Emil wanted to deliver God's majesty by praying in the depths of that place where God's presence was absent.

Descending the Abyss was a daunting task for anyone. But if one were to consider the act a test from God, they would feel no fear. Emil decided that he had to pass this test, and left the town he had been so accustomed to in the hopes of elevating his priesthood.
