Elda was born in an elven settlement in the eastern reaches of the continent. However, he was not a pure-blooded elf. His grandfather was human, making his blood one quarter human as well.

The small settlement was a closed community, with elven traditions deeply-rooted. The pious and insular elves abhorred Elda and his mother, calling their mixed blood tainted.

Whenever the villagers threw stones or chased him away, calling him unclean, young Elda always cried to his parents, asking why he would be treated so.

His parents comforted him, assuring him there were those who accepted his mixed heritage, and that he would be fine as long as he lived as a proper elf.

After all, his grandmother, who had loved a human enough to marry him, and his mother, whose partner was elf, had faced discrimination and supported each other enough to make their lives in the settlement.

Elda was disappointed in his parents who only wanted him to endure the hardship. Only anger and resentment toward the irrationality of rose within him.

Growing up, Elda roamed the woods, weapon in hand, hunting beasts and making his way alone in the mountains and forests.

And, as if venting his pent-up frustrations, he came to relish the thrill of pursuing prey and taking their life.

As people of the forest, elves hunt only what they need and nothing more. The elves of the settlement looked with disgust at Elda, who killed as if for amusement.

But by then, being told he was not behaving as an elf should was like music to Elda's ears. In fact, he gradually began to escalate his behavior, as if mocking elven conventions.

Finally, once he came of age, he left the settlement that had brought him so much pain behind.

He eventually drifted to the capital and found the city quite livable. THe best part was nobody cared if he was of mixed blood or not.

Once, a fast-talking human man tricked him and tried to sell him as a male prostitute, explaining that good-looking elves fetched a high price on the market.

Elda laughed at the irony of being treated as an elf, when his mixed blood had been so abhorred. Without hesitation, he cut down the swindler and tossed his body in a back alley.

Being an adventurer suited Elda just fine. It mattered not if he was of mixed blood or wasn't a conventional elf. He was contented with this sort of life.
