Elda was born in an elven settlement in the eastern reaches of the continent. However, he was not apure-blooded elf. His grandfather was human, making his blood one quarter human as well.

The small settlement was a closed community, with elven traditions deeply-rooted. The pious and insular elves abhorred Elda and his mother, calling their mixed blood tainted.

Whenever the villagers threw stones or chased him away, calling him unclean, young Elda always cried to his parents, asking why he would be treated so.

Elda was disappointed in his parents who only wanted him to endure the hardship. Only anger and resentment toward the irrationality of rose within him.
