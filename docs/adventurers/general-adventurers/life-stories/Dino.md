Dino was a native of a mountainous region to the south, from a small town of elves that overlooked the sea.

The town is said to have been founded by elves who left the forest long ago, and through interaction with others, came to devote themselves to the research of spellcraft. Indeed, most elves living there were involved with spellcraft and research flourished when Dino was there.

Naturally curious, Dino had great affinity with spellcraft and absorbed knowledge quickly, becoming an excellent mage as a result.

Dino's curiosity did not merely stop at spellcraft; he wanted to know the reason and the structure of the world. Whenever he became engrossed in some new subject, he would completely ignore everything else, earning him the reputation as an eccentric in town.

After learning and researching spellcraft for 200 years in his hometown, Dino set off for the capital to satisfy his curiosity on various other matters.

The capital was packed with people of all races and Dino joined the Adventurer's Guild in order to observe them more closely.

Dino quickly earned a reputation in the guild, and not quite in a good way.

He was never picky about jobs. He was as comfortable escorting merchant caravans and helping people as he was taking requests that were little more than banditry. Sometimes he would be proactive, while others he would just watch from afar, providing no support until his allies had completely run out of magic power. He was simply too unpredictable.

His fellow adventurers often decried him as useless, but in the end, he had never failed a request. Using that as a shield, Dino shrugged off anything they said. He stayed ever the same, loyal only to his own curiosity.

As such, even in the taverns, he would often earn the ire of his fellow adventurers by asking improper questions.

One day, Dino told an old mage, "Even with diligent study, your lifespan makes it difficult for you to fully master spellcraft. It is a pity you cannot live as long as I."

The mage's companions stood, outraged by the comment, but the old mage stopped them, giving a hearty laugh.

"There is that which can only be accomplished because of a limited life."

Hearing these words, Dino, intrigued, offered to join his party. Finding the prospect interesting, the old mage agreed.

The thing that Dino most wants to know now is, how the short-lived races go to their demise.
