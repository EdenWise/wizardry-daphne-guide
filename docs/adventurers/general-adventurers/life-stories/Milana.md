Milana was an elf who had been kidnapped by a slave trader. The next thing she knew, she was in a cage, spending her days being stared at by those appraising her.

Children bought by the nobles are whipped, beaten, and worked to death, the slaver gleefully told her over their drink.

She realized that if she didn't get away then, she was done for, and so she and five other children made their escape.

They broke the locks on their cages using rocks and, after casting scornful looks at the trader who was passed out drunk, set fire to the residence and ran as fast as their legs would carry them.

Though they had escaped, with no one to turn to, the children had limited means to survive in the capital. Milana and her friends made a vow to survive, but the city guards would chase them, and one-by-one their numbers dwindled.

One day, they broke into a wealthy merchant's home. They split into two groups, one going for jewelry while Milana took the silverware before meeting at a rendezvous point. But when she got there, she found five guards waiting.

Her friend who was supposed to be keeping a lookout was standing behind them. Milana realized they had been betrayed.

"The elf girl told us to do it! It's all her fault!" her other friend shouted, feeling backed into a corner.

"--My friends sold me out.
Burning that into her heart, Milana dove into the sewers and fled."

Hiding from her pursuers in the barn at a farmhouse on the outskirts of the city, Milana was discovered by the old man who owned the farm.

The old man asked Milana, who was filthy and shaking, what was going on. Then, moved by her story, he asked her if she would live there and work on the farm.

Although hesitant, Milana nodded, and the old man gave her a change of clothes and a warm meal. He even managed to throw the pursuing guards off her scent.

But that night the guards left, Milana fled from the old man. Experience had taught her that no matter how much trust you built, people would betray you.

Though she herself was betraying the old man's kindness, there was no hesitation on her part.
