Flut was born in a tiny elven settlement in the northern mountain range. Her parents were educated in basic spellcraft, giving Flut ample opportunities to see them use spells to stoke the hearth fire or fill pots with water from a very young age.

One day, trying to help her father in the vegetable garden, young Flut cast a spell as she'd seen done and ended up flooding the field.

Flut tearfully apologized for ruining the vegetables, but rather being angry, her father picked her up and praised her for using a spell without anyone teaching her, saying "my child is a genius."

Since then, Flut has been devoted to spellcraft.

Initially, Flut was taught by  her parents and learned simple spells. While being praised for her natural talent, she soon mastered all the basics.

The village elder, once the top mage of a large town in his youth, continued her training after that. Flut learned more spells designed to make life easier, but she soon realized that with a bit of tweaking, the spells could also be used to eradicate harmful pests or protect oneself. With this knowledge in mind, she began to seek out more advanced spells.

The village's vegetable fields were often ravaged by wild beasts. Emboldened by the praise she kept receiving, Flut was inspired to protect her father's farm, as well as the rest of the village, from these beasts.

And, when she was 16, at the urging of the elder who recognized the talent of the still young Flut, she was sent to study in a town to the south where mages gathered.

There, Flut threw herself into her studies, especially lifesaving spells that enhanced strength or kept vermin or Warped Ones at bay.

The great mage Flut apprenticed under in the southern town had once traveled with adventurers into the Abyss. They saved a human king of generations past and helped seal the Abyss which was overflowing with Warped Ones.

Flut grew even more accomplished under his tutelage, and she came to have aspirations of becoming a great mage herself, not only for the elves, but for the world at large.

Decades after beginning her studies in the southern town, Flut received permission from her mentor to leave. With hope in her heart, Flut made her way down to human lands, seeking at first to join the guild.
