There are many rumors about Jarmil the Mage.

He lived in a dilapidated hut at the foot of a large tree by a village near the royal capital, but nobody knew exactly how long he had been living there and it was common for his hut to be empty for ten years at a time.

Even in the nearest village, there is no one who knows who Jarmil really is. Ask farmer or mayor, and all they have to say is "Supposedly he was an old man, even in my grandmother's day." or "He's looked the same ever since I was a child."

When asked, even longtime elven members of the guild would say "I've worked with him occasionally for the past 70 years or so, and he was already an old man when first I met him."

Jarmil was always seen with an apprentice young enough to be his grandson who looked after his home when he was away. When asked about Jarmil's age, this apprentice would brush the question aside saying "Once a human gets old, they stop looking any different." just as Jarmil himself would say.

On occasion, there would be a new apprentice, and when asked about their predecessor, would simply reply, "They graduated."

There are those who claim that, based on the talk of the apprentices, as well as the statements of the elves, Jarmil prolonged his life by absorbing the life force of his apprentices, but nobody really knows.

One thing for sure about Jarmil, was that he liked to drink. And when drunk at the tavern, he was sure to tell the tales of his great adventures.

"Once I nearly lost my entire party to a ferocious dragon guarding its treasure hoard!" "The bottom of the Abyss? No treasures to be had down there. The only thing you'll find is the truth."

Though even the tragedies of his tales had long since gone stale, somehow hearing Jarmil tell them made them all the more compelling.
