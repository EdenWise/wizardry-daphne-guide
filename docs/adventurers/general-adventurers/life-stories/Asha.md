Asha is the third-generation child of a rustic apothecary in a remote village on the western side of the continent. She lived with her mother and grandmother, the latter having been a traveling healer in her youth.

One day, young Asha found an old map in a worn-out leather bag among some junk in the attic. It was a hand-drawn map with notes about exploration of some ruins. Asha though an adventurer might have left behind the location of some great treasure and excitedly brought the map down to show her mother and grandmother.

Seeing the map put Asha's grandmother in a very bad mood. Asha's grandfather had been an adventurer full of wanderlust who always got his way, even when her grandmother became heavy with child, causing her much hardship until she finally split up with him.

Asha's grandmother denounced adventurers, saying it was a worthless profession.

Asha's mother later revealed to her that her father had been an adventurer as well, and that the map belonged to him.

Now Asha knew why they would always avoid the topic whenever she asked why she didn't have a father.

Since then, Asha held on to the map, secretly looking at it from time to time and dreaming of setting off to find her father.

Once she had come of age, she made the decision to set off on her own journey, but could not bring herself to tell her grandmother. For a time, she spent her days agonizing in silence, until the day came when she finally took action to change everything.

One bright, moonlit night, Asha left home without a word to anyone. But as she opened the back door, she found her mother was standing there. Asha's mother had been aware of her internal struggle the entire time.

Her mother smiled at her surprise and said, "When I was young I, too, ran way from home, hoping to see my father who left when I was little."

Searching for her father, she herself had become and adventurer, eventually meeting Asha's father in the royal capital. But her father, searching for relics in the Abyss, never returned, leaving behind her mother, retired from adventuring and with child.

"I understand your desire to find your father," said Asha's mother as she handed her a bundle of items. "I suppose your grandmother must have felt the same for me," she said, wiping away tears and giving Asha an encouraging push on her way.

Asha's life at the capital was far from smooth-sailing.

Upon arrival, a man said he would introduce her to a job, but instead tried to sell her off, and was eventually robbed of all her money. She had originally intended to work at an apothecary, but having lost everything she owned, she was forced to turn to the guild in order to earn her keep.

Nevertheless, no matter what came her way, Asha used to sustain her, and became a better adventurer.

With the thought that she might one day find clues to her father, Asha grew up to become a well-known and renowned magician among adventurers.
