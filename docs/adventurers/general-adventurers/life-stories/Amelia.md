Amelia was among a group of smuggled beastfolk slaves. She had no idea where she was being transported from, whether she'd been kidnapped from the settlement of her birth, or if she had been sold off by her own parents. All she remembered is that she became a slave at the age of seven.

One night, after being loaded into a small cage with a few others, with barely enough food and water to survive, the slave traders were set upon by a pack of goblins.

The wagon overturned, the canvas catching flame, the slave traders fled, abandoned Amelia and the others. The remaining beastfolk were eaten by the goblins.

Amidst the screams of the slaves, Amelia managed to break free of her damaged cage and, as the goblins approached, she pushed a nearby boy toward them and fled all alone.
