Amelia was among a group of smuggled beastfolk slaves. She had no idea where she was being transported from, whether she'd been kidnapped from the settlement of her birth, or if she had been sold off by her own parents. All she remembered is that she became a slave at the age of seven.

One night, after being loaded into a small cage with a few others, with barely enough food and water to survive, the slave traders were set upon by a pack of goblins.

The wagon overturned, the canvas catching flame, the slave traders fled, abandoned Amelia and the others. The remaining beastfolk were eaten by the goblins.

Amidst the screams of the slaves, Amelia managed to break free of her damaged cage and, as the goblins approached, she pushed a nearby boy toward them and fled all alone.

Beastfolk would stand out, easily discriminated against in the human-filled towns. Amelia fled into the mountains, drinking from muddy puddles and eating grass to survive, all the while wandering, trying to go back the way she had come from.

Then, Amelia was discovered by a gang of thieves when she snuck into a cabin they'd been using as a hideout to rest. But, on a whim, the boss decided to take her in, and so she became part of their group.

She was taught how to pick locks and disarm traps. Her small size proved useful, and so she was tasked with leading the way into ruins and caves. Though sometimes she became trapped and had a few close clls, but she stubbornly survived them all.

However, the she overheard the thieves discussing plans to sell her to the slave traders, so she emptied their coffers and disappeared into the dark.

After fleeing the band of thieves, Amelia arrived at the capital and joined the Thief's Guild in order to make full use of the skills she had acquired.

Ordinarily, she would have needed a master's recommendation to join, but she located someone quite flexible, paid them enough to set herself up as a thief in her own right.

The royal capital was a comfortable place to live in, but there were a great number of humans who discriminated against beastfolk.

On one request, when Amelia warned her party to proceed carefully, they mocked her, calling her a cowardly beast. She led them into a trap that she had not yet disarmed and left them there.

If she didn't like her companions, she could just move on. If she did like them, she could treat them right for the time being. Amelia lived by instinct, and it continued to serve her well for survival.
