Barbara is from the island of beastfolk across the sea.

The island is ruled by a king and his right-hand man, Duke Zart. Barbara's own noble house was very well-trusted by the duke.

Barbara's mother was wet nurse to the duke's daughter, Elissa. As a result, Barbara was raised as a foster sibling to Elissa, and from an early age, they were like close sisters.

Eventually, Barbara began to think of Elissa as a real sister. And so, wishing to protect her for as long as she lived, she asked to be trained by the duke's knights, and began honing her sword skills.

With practice, her talent quickly blossomed. When Elissa was wed to the king and became queen, Barbara was even allowed to accompany her to the palace as captain of the queen's guard.

However, the time of happiness did not last, and just five years after Elissa had given birth to Prince Leo, the king fell ill and passed away. Prince Leo was crowned his successor at the tender age of five and Elissa became queen mother before she could properly mourn. Barbara continued to pledge her full loyalty to Elissa.

And then, three years after King Leo was crowned, a large group of soldiers suddenly surrounded the palace. The minister had incited a rebellion against the royal family. The group demanded custody of the young king, flaunting the head of Duke Zart as a warning.

Elissa ordered Barbara to take the king's inner circle and escape. "I will speak with the enemy while you flee with the king." Queen Mother Elissa order that she be left behind that the king might live.

With the young king on her back, Barbara followed the grave command and fled the burning castle with a few of the king's retainers. And, fighting back tears, she made her way to the port without looking back.

Unfortunately, their ship met with rough seas and capsized. When Barbara came to, she was alone on a beach of the admiralty.

Neither the retainers who had escaped with her nor the young king, who Elissa had entrusted to her with her own life, were anywhere to be seen.

Barbara walked the beach towns searching for the king. Whenever she saw a child that was of the same age she would run up to them, and so caught the notice of many a town guard.

Eventually Barbara decided to join the guild in the admiralty to earn money while searching for clues to the king. A king with the blood of a beastfolk should not disappear so easily. She firmly believed she would find him one day and that they would return to their kingdom and crush the rebellion. Barbara continues to seek clues to the king's whereabouts that they might reclaim their once-peaceful kingdom.
