The remote village of Lacus is located even further north than the snowy forest. Elise was born in this tiny village, home to only about 20 elves.

The northern lands are always cold, and if the firewood were to run out, one would quickly freeze. The deep forests surrounding the village were also home to dangerous beasts that would attack them from time to time.

One day, all the able-bodied men of the village were out hunting when they were caught in an avalanche and none returned. The only men left in the village were either children or the elderly.

It now fell to the women to wield the swords to protect the village from wild beasts and the axes to harvest the firewood. Young Elise joined in this hard work alongside everyone else.

There was one old warrior who was injured and no longer able to fight. The women begged him to teach them the ways of the sword, that they might defend the village.

He didn't go easy on them because they were women, and his training was harsh, but there was one else to turn do the job. Desperate to learn, Elise acquired skills that even the old warrior had to recognize.

One time, a village child was kidnapped when they went into the forest. Ignoring the villagers' pleas not to, Elise gave pursuit on horseback to save the child.

Catching up to the kidnapper's wagon, Elise doggedly challenged the men aboard, though there were several of them and they were much larger than she.

The next thing Elise knew, she had the crying child in her arms. Realizing for the first time that she was capable of protecting the village, she felt confident in her own abilities.

Years after the tragic event that took the lives of the village men, the elder decided to merge with the village across the river.

Their population grew to 50 residents, 10 of whom were young men.

The women passed on the grueling physical labor and were relieved to be able to live their lives in safety.

And Elise's coveted role of warrior was taken from her.

She visited her mentor, the old warrior, and pleaded desperately with him to convince the adults of the village to allow her to live as a warrior.

But the old warrior simply shook his head, saying that it was because Elise had worked so hard to protect the village that she should enjoy the life of a normal girl now. The old knight sincerely wished her happiness.

That very night, Elise left the village in silence. She was already a warrior and was could not return to a life of weakness, only being protected. She set off on a journey to find a place where she was needed.
