Galina was born the daughter of a long-standing family of priests in an elven settlement at the foot of a mountain range in the north.

Her mother gave birth to Galina after much difficulty and passed away soon after. Her father and grandfather pitied her for losing her mother at such a young age, but they were certain that it was a test from God. Galina was raised more strictly than other children, in an environment where lapses in faith were severely punished while acts of devotion were highly praised.

Galina's father and grandfather disciplined her strictly in accordance with their faith. They wanted for her to grow into a proud elf who would not be bullied or demeaned by others for growing up without a mother.

Galina eventually became the priest she was meant to be. A rigid one who could not abide ambiguity.

Galina despised those only turned to God only in times of need, and considered charity toward those who didn't pray to God to be futile. That strict way of thinking often lead to disagreements in the settlement.

--Galina lacks compassion.
But she should change once she had a family and children of her own. Nearly 100 years passed since her grandfather and father wished that for her, but Galina's thinking has never changed.

One day, her concerned father and grandfather came to her saying, "There are ill tidings in the human capital. You must investigate with your own eyes and send regular reports back. This mission will also bring God's teachings to the humans."

Galina refused, saying that there was no point in proselytizing to the mundane, worldly humans. But her father and grandfather insisted that because it was such a difficult undertaking, she was the only one who could accomplish it.

"You must go. And you will get along with the humans. God watches over your every action."

Hearing these words, that God was watching over her, inspired Galina. After all, anything is possible when you have faith. She changed her attitude and set off for the kingdom to take up the investigation.

Galina delivered regular reports on the uneasiness around the capital. But she made sure not to mention being swindled of her money along the way and the fact that she joined the guild in order to earn her way.

And so Galina, while working as an adventurer, set her eyes on the Abyss as the source of unease, and decided to venture within for further investigation.
