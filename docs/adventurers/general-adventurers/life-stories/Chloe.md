Chloe was born in a smallish fishing village in the southwestern part of the continent. A plague took her parents' lives when she was still a babe, and so she was brought up by her grandparents.

Her grandparents had been persecuted fled from another country. They told her time and again of their experiences and how "humans are fearsome."

But the words of her grandparents fell flat with Chloe. The lands where their fishing village stood were relatively tolerant of other races, and nobody in the village discriminated against even the beastfolk.

Still, her grandmother would forbid her from leaving the village, fearing that humans outside might hurt her. Chloe thus grew up healthy in a village without persecution, and knowing little of the world.

One day, she spotted a wagon on an old, unused road while out exploring in the forest. Chloe approached the wagon, thinking they might be lost. Then she looked in the wagon bed and was shocked by what she say. There was a beastfolk lying chained within.

Now knowing that her grandmother spoke the truth, Chloe angrily launched herself at the driver. She struck down the two guards next to him, but before she could reach the driver, she was seized by another guard and beaten until she coughed blood.

Just as the driver was about to take Chloe away a slave as well when he heard the voices of the villagers who had come looking for Chloe when she had failed to return home on time. Annoyed, the driver clicked his tongue and quickly fled.

Realizing how powerless she was, Chloe sobbed and begged Kokino, a former adventurer living in the village, to teach her how to defend herself as well as practical fighting skills.

Chloe had strong arms from helping her grandparents with their fishing work, her skills as a fighter blossomed, and she began working with the men to exterminate the vermin that attacked the village.

The villagers praised Chloe's prowess and she came to have pride in herself.

Two years after that, she decided to leave the village despite her grandparents' protests.

"I must find those beastfolk that are being abused by horrible humans, and this time I will help them!"
