Benjamin was raised in a mining village in the southern part of the continent, bordering a remote forest.

This was a region where harm from vermin and monsters was common, and his father was not only a craftsman, but a warrior respected for his bravery.

But one day, while out playing, Benjamin was attacked by an enormous monster known as the Lord of the Mountain.

His father, axe in hand, stood alone before the monster to defend his son, somehow managing to drive the monster back into the mountains.

But the injuries sustained during battle eventually took his father's life.
