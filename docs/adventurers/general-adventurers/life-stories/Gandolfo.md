Born and raised in an inn district near the port on the royal capital's trade route, Gandolfo lived with his mother in the brothel where she worked as a courtesan while waiting for his sailor father to return.

Ever since he was a boy, Gandolfo's mother would regale him with tales of his father's travels. He grew up admiring the gallant image his mother depicted, and often begged to meet him.

"He told us we can't go with him because it's too dangerous. But he'll come back one day. I'm sure of it."

Seeing his mother by the window, gazing toward the harbor and whispering to herself, Gandolfo decided it was his duty to protect her in place of the father he had yet to meet.

The fragile demeanor of Gandolfo's mother tended to stir up a protective spirit in her clients, and they often got into fights with each other over her.

Although Gandolfo aspired to become a sailor like his father, he knew the men from the port were ruffians and could not bear to leave his mother to fend for herself. He chose to work as a bouncer at the brothel instead.

Gandolfo worked there for several years, having trained in the use of weapons.

Having grown larger than most of the men around him, people had come to respect Gandolfo. One day, a passing customer at the bar told him that his father was nothing more than a wayward sailor, and that his mother's stories had all been fantasies.

"Told you she's been waiting for him, did she? She's been sayin' that to anyone who'll listen since forever."

Taunted by claims that it was a woman's ploy for sympathy, flew into a rage.

After starting a brawl, Gandolfo fled the bar, leaving the man bloodied and broken.
