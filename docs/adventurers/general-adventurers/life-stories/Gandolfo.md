Born and raised in an inn district near the port on the royal capital's trade route, Gandolfo lived with his mother in the brothel where she worked as a courtesan while waiting for his sailor father to return.

Ever since he was a boy, Gandolfo's mother would regale him with tales of his father's travels. He grew up admiring the gallant image his mother depicted, and often begged to meet him.

"He told us we can't go with him because it's too dangerous. But he'll come back one day. I'm sure of it."

Seeing his mother by the window, gazing toward the harbor and whispering to herself, Gandolfo decided it was his duty to protect her in place of the father he had yet to meet.
