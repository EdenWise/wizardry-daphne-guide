    Due to the bugs relating to this quest, it’s currently unclear if Ugo is the same child who appears looking for his mother in the earlier maps (B1F and Ship’s Hold) and if interacting with him is needed for acquiring the bondmate. There's also no confirmation that buying anything from him is necessary.

#### Monster Bird Soup

??? info "Request"
    ![](img/image_65.png)

!!! info
    This request is exclusive to the Pontiff route

!!! danger
    This request leads to a boss that is arguably harder than the true greater warped one of this abyss. In addition, there seem to be a fair number of bugs when starting this request, particularly around Pickerel spawning.

    It is highly recommended to wait to do this request until after all three routes have been cleared.

    ??? info "Read if you have trouble with Pickerel spawning"
        The easiest way to get him to spawn seems to be to do the following:
        - Wheel to the Admiral route and make sure you have killed Melgina or Octo
        - Wheel to Arena 3 of the Pontiff route
        - Find Pickerel at the marked location

- Once you get to Round 3 and see that Pickerel is your next opponent, don’t head out to fight him.  
- Go to x and find him at the location in the image to overhear him talking to the head chef  
- Speak with the head chef and he’ll tell you where to pick up the ingredients to make the soup  
- Head to Valeon Grasslands and you’ll see a slave that runs away, just run a bit forward and you’ll see him on a hill then talk to him  
- Follow the slaves instructions to get to the poison swamps  
- Fight the bird and kill it  
- Use your right hand to restore the bird nest then head to the eggs left of the nest to restore them and head out by using the cart
