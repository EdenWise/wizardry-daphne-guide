# Discipline and Inheritance

## Discipline
Discipline boosts all of your stats by a set amount per duplicate (not per skill level) and can go up to a maximum skill level of 9 at 1500 Mastery. The amount each stat gets boosted is static, but it's not completely uniform. It also seems to be a bigger boost for Legendary Adventurers than General or Anonymous Adventurers. The numbers below reflect the Discipline gains for Adventurers.

Stats seem to be broken up into four main categories:

* General Stats (most stats)
    * General stats see a boost of +2 per dupe (increased at each Discipline skill level) for Discipline levels 1-6 and an average of +1.5 per dupe for Discipline levels 7-9.
* Featured Stat (Adam's is Magic Power, for example)
    * The Featured stat sees a higher than +2 per dupe increase, but it's less uniform. The increases are always the same across Adventurers at a given Discipline level, but the individual amounts vary between +1 and +3 per dupe on top of the General stat boost.
* HP
    * HP is similar to the Featured stat, however its individual amounts vary between +8 and +19 per dupe (or between +10 and +22 per dupe if HP is the Featured stat), ignoring the General stat boost
* ASPD
    * ASPD sees a smaller than +2 per dupe increase, varying between +1 and +3 per dupe, ignoring the General stat boost

As you can see, this means that while Discipline can add up at higher skill levels, the actual performance impact you see will be variable. A key exception here is the increase to HP can add up to be fairly significant.

## Inheritance
Inheritance allows you to give skills from one adventurer to another or increase the level of inherited skills on an adventurer. Skills have different maximum levels. For example, Legendary and General Adventurer skills have a maximum inheritance count of 6, so depending on if an adventurer comes with that skill by default, they can get it to either level 6 or level 7. Anonymous adventurer skills have a maximum inheritance count of 14, which leads to a maximum level of either 14 or 15, again depending on if an adventurer comes with that skill by default.

## Should I use my duplicates for Discipline or Inheritance?
This is an extremely frequently asked and hotly debated question, and there is no general, community-wide consensus. Both are potentially solid options, and here are some pros and cons of each.

!!! note "Some of these pros and cons are only applicable to Legendary duplicate usage"

### Discipline Pros and Cons
* Pro: Stat gains are never a bad thing
* Pro: Stat gains will always be relevant no matter what active skills you use
* Pro: HP gains are pretty standout, as are stats to things like Disarm Trap where a small number of static points go a long way
* Con: Attack and Magic power gains in particular are small. At max Discipline, you're generally looking at 28-40ish points more (the higher end if it's a featured stat), which ultimately amounts to less than that in more damage per basic attack
* Con: Discipline is a very low impact per duplicate
* Con: It takes a very high Discipline level to have a very noticeable stat gain, with low Discipline levels resulting in largely negligible changes
* Con: Discipline is a static value and will become less impactful as base stats increase due to level increases

### Inheritance Pros and Cons
* Pro: Skill inheritance to the source adventurer can make a very noticeable immediate impact
* Pro: Inheriting a skill to another adventurer can provide more overall team versatility and utility than increasing one adventurer's Discipline
* Pro: The logarithmic nature of damage skills means inheritance is necessary for them to stay relevant as attack power grows
* Pro: The overall duplicate cost of maximum skill inheritance is lower than the duplicate cost of maximum Discipline
* Con: Primarily with active skills, inheriting can greatly increase the SP/MP costs, making it less likely that you'll be able to use a skill frequently
* Con: Primarily with active skills, inheriting to a skill could result in "wasted" dupes long-term if new active skills get released that are notably stronger than an adventurer's signature skill
* Con: Some inheritable skills have very little value after an initial inherit, while it's hard to measure the value of other skill inherits

The following is TheAxolotl's opinion - feel free to consider it, but I encourage you to form your own opinion, as well.

To be blunt, I am not a big fan of Discipline in general. It's fine - more stats are always good, and if you go as far as getting up to Discipline 9, you can get a hefty ~28 added to most stats (and potentially more to the featured stats). The problem I have is that the value per dupe spent on Discipline is relatively low.

I consider there being three main breakpoints for Discipline:

1. Discipline 1: This unlocks the passive skill, and while it doesn't make a massive tangible impact on performance, I personally hate having locked skills on adventurers I use
2. Discipline 6: This maximizes the +2 stats per level rate and gives us roughly +16 stats for 8 dupes (9 copies total)
3. Discipline 9: Might as well go all out

An honorable mention goes to Disciplines 2 and 5, which are the last of the Disc levels where 1 Dupe = 1 Disc (albeit to get to 5, you do have to use 2 dupes for Disc 3).

Alternatively, Skill Inheritance can have equivalent or better impact on overall party performance for a similar or lesser dupe cost, particularly when you consider that skills generally see a jump in effectiveness on odd levels. Discipline 3 takes 4 dupes to achieve. With those 4 dupes, you could increase a Legendary Adventurer's skill level to level 3 (costing you 3 dupes) and still have a single dupe left over to either get to Disc 1 or inherit that skill on another adventurer, like your MC.

Is Discipline bad? Not at all - stat increases are always good. Is Discipline better than Skill Inherit? This is very debatable, but my opinion is very rarely.

What do I do with my dupes? I have a general process of:

1. First dupe - Discipline 1, strictly for my OCD. I don't like locked skills.
2. Additional duplicates - inherit to the MC or other adventurers OR get the featured Legendary's skill to an odd level (3 is a great target, 5 or 7 are good if you have a lot of dupes) for a noticeable damage boost
3. Once I hit the skill levels I want on whatever adventurers I want to give it to, only then will I consider going for more Discipline levels
