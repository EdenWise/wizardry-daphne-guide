## Quick Start

For an optimal result from Blacksmithing, apply improvements in the following order:

1. Alteration (if applicable)  
2. Enhancement  
3. Refinement (use the highest stat stone available)

## Basics of Blacksmithing

### Extraction

Extracting destroys an item, with a small chance of producing an Alteration Stone or Refinement Stone that can be used to modify or increase substats on items.

The type of stone produced will be randomly selected from one of the substats on the item under extraction.

Only weapons, armor and accessories can be extracted.

### Refinement

Refining an item increases the value of a substat, and requires a Refinement Stone.

Refinement bonuses are lost when the substat is upgraded via Enchanting.

### Alteration

Refining an item modifies a substat, and requires an Alteration Stone.

After enhancement to \+5, you can only **Alter** the substat that was last upgraded.

### Enhancement Inheritance

Enhancement Inheritance sacrifices an existing enchanted item to increase the enchantment value of another item.

This helps save gold when changing to higher quality equipment when you have already enchanted your existing equipment.

### Unification

## Advanced Blacksmithing

### Advanced Extraction

The star quality of an item being extracted determines the magnitude of the stones produced. 

Extracting higher quality items results in larger boni granted by the stones.

**Tip:** Altering a high quality item with a low-grade Stone and then extracting the resulting item will result in a higher quality Stone, as the game only considers **item quality** and **type of available substats** when generating a Stone, not the magnitude of the substats.

Full Alteration

A **Full Alteration Stone** allows you to reroll all unlocked substats on an item.

It is a very rare outcome from **Extraction**.
