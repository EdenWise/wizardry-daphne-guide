# Collect on a Broken Pact

## Request Requirements

* Gerulf must be on the party
* Certain Trust Level must be achieved with Gerulf

Once the requirements are met, the request will be available at the
Adventurer's Guild at the Royal Capital Lukmalia.

### Important Notice

This request can only be finished **once**. If you missed something, you won't
be able to go back for it. So don't rush it!

## Request Mission

Request is a dive into Gerulf's backstory, consisting of a single explorable
dungeon level and a boss room level. Mission is to collect special type of Ore
pieces and then beat the boss.

Encounter rate is below average, mobs are mostly unavoidable but manageable and
consist entirely of fire type enemies. Dungeon is overall a comfortable one
with focus on exploration; mobs also don't seem to respawn.

Bossfight at the end is on the tougher side, but straightforward with no
gimmicks or special requirements.

### Map

Below is a map of the dungeon, but I lacked the foresight to mark Ore pieces on
it while collecting so you will need to find them yourself. Pay special
attention, there was at least one piece behind several unavoidable poison
tiles, in a corner of a room on the west side of the map.

## Rewards

You are presented with a choice between a weapon and an armor. Weapon is a 2H
mace of fire type, armor unknown. Quality of the reward very likely depends on
finding **all** Ore pieces, but due to the nature of the request, this is
difficult to verify conclusively. At least, it is known that if you did *not*
find all the pieces, Lulunarde will lament this fact in an ending cutscene.

For reference, below is the mace I got from it - YMMV. After enhancing to +5,
the weapon has base Attack Power 92x1, other stats unchanged.
