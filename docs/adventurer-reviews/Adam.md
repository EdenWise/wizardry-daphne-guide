## TheAxolotl's Analysis:

Adam provides very consistent damage and longevity for a mage due to his two unique skills. Reducing the dampening of damage means he's not as impacted when fighting enemies that are strong against Light damage. His main downside is that he innately only can deal Light damage. This can be offset by inheriting some single target spells that deal other elements of damage, however without the inheritance, he will only have an elemental advantage against enemies weak to light.

His inheritable unique skill gets an extra nod in that if it is inherited by another character, that character will receive the full bonus of the damage dampening. This has incredible potential to boost the damage dealt by the MC (or your favorite damage dealers) and makes his duplicates extremely valuable to have.

Compared to Yekaterina, his damage will generally be more consistent, and he will be able to cast more spells overall, however he will be missing out on the bonus damage to undead and multiple innate elemental type coverages. This can be overcome by inheriting other spells on him to give him additional elemental coverage. Early game, the extra longevity will be nice, but will become less relevant as MP pools get higher and MP potions become obtainable. Still, he's an excellent pull and you have many options for spending his duplicates.

## Duplicate Usage:

1. If you like Adam and plan to use him on your team, boosting his Discipline level will increase his damage
2. Inherit his skill on your MC
3. Inherit his skill on your other favorite damage dealers or save for future use
