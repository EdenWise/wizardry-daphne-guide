### Discipline Skill: Ira's Divine Protection

## TheAxolotl's Analysis:

Alice is a fantastic unit to pull, and will likely be a staple in most folks' parties for a long while. Not only is she our only Legendary priest, but both of her skills are fantastic. Increasing her buff/debuff turn count by 1 means she gets an extra turn to heal, deal damage, or apply another buff/debuff before needing to reapply the initial. Furthermore, her damage increase to a row can apply to our current best damage dealers (Adam, Yeka, Gerulf, and a Neutral or Evil MC). Alice is no slouch in the damage department herself, either, being able to hit hard with single target Light damage that is based on her Divine Power and also deals increased damage to undead. Giving her Discipline levels will further increase her damage and healing potential.

To make things even better, many other characters will benefit from Alice duplicates. Inheriting her skill on your other favorite buffers/debuffers will allow them to each provide an extra turn for their buffs/debuffs\!

It has been reported that the turn duration increase from her Blessing of Agora skill adds one to the counter at rank three, so it's possible to get at least a 5-turn duration on buffs and debuffs, which adds to the strength increasing her skill through inheritence.

You absolutely want to get Alice on your team\!

**NOTE: There is potentially a bug with inheriting Alice's skill (or maybe with the skill itself). I merged an Alice copy to MC and do not see any turn count increases for Warrior's  Battle Cry, Self-Healing, or the debuff from Armor Break. I've reported this and will hopefully hear back about it at some point.**

## Duplicate Usage:

1. Inherit her skill on other buffers/debuffers you use. Note that this should include any damage dealers that have self-buffing or boss-debuffing capabilities. See note above for potential bug.
2. If you plan to use Alice (you should), increasing her Discipline will increase her damage and healing.
3. Save for future use.
