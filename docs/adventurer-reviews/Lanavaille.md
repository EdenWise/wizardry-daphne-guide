## TheAxolotl's Analysis:

Lanavaille is our first Legendary Knight, and she's pretty great at it! Not only does she provide defensive capabilities, her ability to buff a Good/Neutral row can be very powerful, particularly if you have a Good/Neutral MC. A front row of Lanavaille - MC - Debra is very common at the moment, and all three units would benefit from the increased damage.

In addition to her battle prowess, Lanavaille's end of battle heal is extremely valuable early game. The initial heal amount is 12, and it increases (by 10 or 12 alternating) with each skill level. While this does become less impactful when you get up to level 20+, it's still nothing to frown upon, and it can absolutely be a life saver in the early game.

Lanavaille has quite a few options for duplicate use, and it's arguable which is the best. Increasing her skill level will make her end of battle heal continue to provide value at later levels, and increasing her Discipline level will allow her to deal more damage with Stun Bash and receive less damage. Alternatively, inheriting her skill on the MC would allow you to continue to receive a post-battle heal (albeit reduced) when future Knights (or other classes) get released that render her less useful.

If you get her now, absolutely put her in her party, however she is likely going to be powercrept by other units going forward, particularly if more come along that provide personality-oriented buffs.

## Duplicate Usage:

1. If you use her Wandering Princess style, inherit her standard style to her own skill to increase its healing power.
2. If you use her standard style and not her Wandering Princess style, Discipline is always a good choice.
3. Inherit her skill to the MC.
4. Save for future use. It's possible that she'll end up becoming a good candidate in the future to dismiss for Grade tags.
