### TheAxolotl's Analysis:

Lanavaille is our first Legendary Knight, and she's pretty great at it! Not only does she provide defensive capabilities, her ability to buff a Good/Neutral row can be very powerful, particularly if you have a Good/Neutral MC. A front row of Lanavaille - MC - Debra is very common at the moment, and all three units would benefit from the increased damage.

In addition to her battle prowess, Lanavaille's end of battle heal is extremely valuable early game. The initial heal amount is 12, and it increases (by 10 or 12 alternating) with each skill level. While this does become less impactful when you get up to level 20+, it's still nothing to frown upon, and it can absolutely be a life saver in the early game.

Lanavaille has quite a few options for duplicate use, and it's arguable which is the best. Increasing her skill level will make her end of battle heal continue to provide value at later levels, and increasing her Discipline level will allow her to deal more damage with Stun Bash and receive less damage. Alternatively, inheriting her skill on the MC would allow you to continue to receive a post-battle heal (albeit reduced) when future Knights (or other classes) get released that render her less useful.

If you get her now, absolutely put her in her party, however she is likely going to be powercrept by other units going forward, particularly if more come along that provide personality-oriented buffs.

### Duplicate Usage:

1. If you use her Wandering Princess style, inherit her standard style to her own skill to increase its healing power.
2. If you use her standard style and not her Wandering Princess style, Discipline is always a good choice.
3. Inherit her skill to the MC.
4. Save for future use. It's possible that she'll end up becoming a good candidate in the future to dismiss for Grade tags.

### TheAxolotl's Analysis:

The newly fixed skills for Wandering Lanavaille are quite interesting, as they provide some nice minor buffs without fundamentally changing the character itself. We'll have to see how much of a boost it is when the skill changes are actually released, but Valiant Righteousness in particular has the potential to make Lana faster than most MC builds. This will improve her support capabilities by potentially allowing her to get in a Stun Bash or Armor Break before the MC attacks. To maximize on this, you will absolutely want to make sure she's using a 1h sword and light armor.

The changes to her Discipline are also nice - you should never say no to more HP, and Critical Tolerance will help prevent instant death, which is always good.

Neither of these skill changes are game-breaking by any means, so if you don't like Lanavaille as an adventurer, you won't really be missing out on anything by skipping her. If you like her, though, her Wandering Princess form is all around better than her standard form and going for a couple copies wouldn't be a bad idea at all.

Based on what we've been told about the merge behavior, whether or not you pull on Wandering Princess will dictate what you likely want to do with her standard duplicates. Due to the fact that Discipline is tied to the style, if you're using the Wandering Princess form, standard form copies should not be applied to the standard form's Discipline as that would be completely wasted in Wandering Princess form. Instead, you'll want to apply any Wandering Princess duplicates to Discipline, which will free up standard form duplicates to go towards her inheritable skill.

I'll also add a note about Blade Cuisinart. This is currently the single best weapon you can get in the game due to the fact that multiple hits currently scale the best in terms of damage. This is the only 3-hit sword for the time, and if you're pulling on the paid banner, you have a 30% chance when getting a Wandering Princess Lanavaille copy to get it. Keep in mind that this could be fairly costly due to the gacha nature of the game.

### Duplicate Usage:

1. If you use her, you should absolutely prioritize Wandering Princess copies towards her Discipline. Let her standard form duplicates go towards skill inheritance.
