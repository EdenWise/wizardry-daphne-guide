## TheAxolotl's Analysis:

Gerulf does one thing and one thing well. He hits hard with a 2h mace. If you're not using him with a 2h mace, he's not living up to his full potential. Unfortunately, there are some things that work against him right now. Since he's evil, he will actually hinder a party that uses Lanavaille, as both of them want to be in the front row and having them both there will negate Lanavaille's row buff. This likely won't be a permanent limitation, though, since in the future we should be able to build a strong Neutral/Evil front row.

While his Eruption Strike can be inherited on another character, like your MC, it will not be at full strength. While having a Fire element attack could be helpful, it's hard to say if the reduced damage elemental strike would be stronger than Heavy Attack or Precision Strike, but I suspect not.

If you like him, by all means use him. He has great future potential, however at the time of game launch, I think he is one of the weaker Legendary choices.

## Duplicate Usage:

1. If you use him, Discipline will increase his damage.
2. Inherit on his own skill will increase the damage and cost of his Eruption Strike.
3. Save for future use. He is also a current candidate to dismiss for Grade tags.
