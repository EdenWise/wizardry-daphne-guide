### TheAxolotl's Analysis:

Debra is our first Legendary thief, and she is great at it. She can deal strong damage for a thief, particularly later on when you have both Hiding and Sneak Attack unlocked. Her skills also allow her to regularly use Precision Strike to kill enemies for a net 0 SP use. When fighting bosses, her debuffs can be very helpful, with an extra nod to Delay Attack.

That being said, it's very likely that other thieves might be released in the future that end up powercreeping her, and a thief MC could very well end up actually being better at being a thief than she is. She's extremely helpful to have now, but it's hard to say if she'll remain strong in the future. One extra note is that inheriting Debra's skill on other characters at very high levels can restore large amounts of SP upon kill.

### Duplicate Usage:

1. If you use her, increasing her Discipline will increase her damage.
2. Save for future use. It's possible that she'll end up becoming a good candidate in the future to dismiss for Grade tags.
3. Inheriting her skill on your MC (or other physical damage dealers) can help them out a bit. At skill level 1, the SP restore is minimal (2 sp per kill) but the inheritance value will go up as that inherited skill level increases.
