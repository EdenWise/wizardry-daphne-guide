### TheAxolotl's Analysis:

The newly fixed skills for Wandering Lanavaille are quite interesting, as they provide some nice minor buffs without fundamentally changing the character itself. We'll have to see how much of a boost it is when the skill changes are actually released, but Valiant Righteousness in particular has the potential to make Lana faster than most MC builds. This will improve her support capabilities by potentially allowing her to get in a Stun Bash or Armor Break before the MC attacks. To maximize on this, you will absolutely want to make sure she's using a 1h sword and light armor.

The changes to her Discipline are also nice - you should never say no to more HP, and Critical Tolerance will help prevent instant death, which is always good.

Neither of these skill changes are game-breaking by any means, so if you don't like Lanavaille as an adventurer, you won't really be missing out on anything by skipping her. If you like her, though, her Wandering Princess form is all around better than her standard form and going for a couple copies wouldn't be a bad idea at all.

Based on what we've been told about the merge behavior, whether or not you pull on Wandering Princess will dictate what you likely want to do with her standard duplicates. Due to the fact that Discipline is tied to the style, if you're using the Wandering Princess form, standard form copies should not be applied to the standard form's Discipline as that would be completely wasted in Wandering Princess form. Instead, you'll want to apply any Wandering Princess duplicates to Discipline, which will free up standard form duplicates to go towards her inheritable skill.

I'll also add a note about Blade Cuisinart. This is currently the single best weapon you can get in the game due to the fact that multiple hits currently scale the best in terms of damage. This is the only 3-hit sword for the time, and if you're pulling on the paid banner, you have a 30% chance when getting a Wandering Princess Lanavaille copy to get it. Keep in mind that this could be fairly costly due to the gacha nature of the game.

### Duplicate Usage:

1. If you use her, you should absolutely prioritize Wandering Princess copies towards her Discipline. Let her standard form duplicates go towards skill inheritance.
