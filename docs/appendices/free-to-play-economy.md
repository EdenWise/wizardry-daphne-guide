The game provides numerous methods for purchasing resources, either at the [Wizardry Variants Daphne Official Store](https://store.wizardry.info) or in game at the Jeweler (see [Guide Purchase Evalutaions page](./purchase-evaluation.md)).  For Free-to-Play players, however, accumulation rates are described below.  Note that the summary tries to cover regular, reliable accumulation methods. Other events can providing addtional resource gain opporutunities, a few of these are noted where appropriate.  Also, purchasing Mission Passes can increase the accumulation rate of certain resources, but is not discussed below. 

## Gems
There are two types of Gems: Gems of Erin (Purple) and Gems of Org (Green).  Purple Gems can only be obtained throug on e of the purchase methods mentioned above.  For the most part, Purple and Green gems exchange at the same rate for the items, although certain Jeweler items are reserved for purchase with Purple gems.  Unless noted otherwise, accumulation details below refer only to Green Gems.

### Uses
Gems can be used throughout the game as a general currency for upgrades at the Jeweler (e.g., adventurer bones, equipment packs, spellbooks, class change books, ...) and in-game activities (e.g., resurrections, Mausoleum assistance, expanded inventory space, relic removal, ...). For some in-game activities gem usage is an option instead of spending Gold for the same item. Gems are scarce enough that use for those cases is discouraged. Popular uses are listed here:

#### "Banner" Adventurer Bones:
- The most popular gems use is to get adventurer bones that give a chance (typically 4-5%) to obtain new Legendary characters or new skins for existing characters.
- Limited time special bones are available from the Jeweler and typically cost 200 gems each, or 11 bones for 2000 gems.
- Limited bones usually give, along with the random character, one 'pity' token that can be exchanged at the jeweler.
- Typcially 100 (for legendary) or 60 (for non-legendary) tokens can be exchanged for bones that guarantee obtaining the banner character.
- Thus the minumum gem cost 100% guarantee getting the banner is:
    - 60: 5 x 2000 + 5 + 200 = 11,000 gems
    - 100: 9 x 2000 + 1 x 200 = 18,200 gems
    - Occasionally banner events include 2-4 free bones that sligthly reduce the above "guarantee" requirement.
    - Using the maximum regular gem rate of 2800 gems/month, a 'guaranteed pull' for a banner legendary character takes 18,200 / 2,800 = 6.5 months to accumulate.
    - This is often significantly reduced by irregular sources, with monthly 'possible' gem rates above being 3400-5300, reducing the time to 3.4-5.3 months.
    
#### Handbooks
- Ally class changes require class-change handbooks or similar items for every class change event for that character.
- Usually four class change books are randomly available each week at the Jeweler, at a cost of 400 gems each,with two limited to Purple Gems.

#### Inventory Storage Increase:
- The default inventory storage space is 500 slots (does not include item slots in an adventurer's personal inventory).
- The limit can be increased by 25 items for 100 gems up to 1000 slots for total of 2000 gems.

## Guild Points
Guild points (blue tokens) are granted for completing activities at the Adventurers Guild

## Adventurer Bones
### Uses:
In this game, adventurer bones are used by the Masked Adventurer to resurrect allies to help him in his adventure.  Bones can be specific to one particular adventurer, or to a group or type of adventurer, or can be ordinary bones that pull from the general adventurer pool.  Gaining additional adventurers increases your party options and gaining duplicate copies of adventurers can increase the power of your adventuring party in numerous ways by [allowing skills to be inherited or increased in power](../mechanics/discipline-and-inheritance.md), or by providing adventurer tags for [grading up to higher levels](../abyss-guides/grade-exams/maps.md). As such accumulating adventurer bones is one of the primary ways, even a necessary way, of advancing in the game.

## Guild Tags
Guild Tags are an important resource in Wizardry Variants Daphne, as they are required to raise a character's Grade which in turn limits the maximum level the adventurer can reach.  An [exam must be passed and a Tag payment must be made](../abyss-guides/grade-exams/maps.md) to rise above level 20, and for every 10 levels thereafter.  In addition, each grade requires a Guild Tag [that is formed by Unifying three tags of the previous level](../frequently-asked-questions.md#how-do-i-get-grade-tags).  

### Tag Requirements per Adventurer per Grade
| Grade    | Max Level | Previous Grade Tags | Equivalent Ungraded Tags | Cumulative Ungraded Tags |

| Ungraded | 20    | 0 | 0  | 0   |
