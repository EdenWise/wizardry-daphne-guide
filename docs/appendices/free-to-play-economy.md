### Uses
Gems can be used throughout the game as a general currency for upgrades at the Jeweler (e.g., adventurer bones, equipment packs, spellbooks, class change books, ...) and in-game activities (e.g., resurrections, Mausoleum assistance, expanded inventory space, relic removal, ...). For some in-game activities gem usage is an option instead of spending Gold for the same item. Gems are scarce enough that use for those cases is discouraged. Popular uses are listed here:

#### "Banner" Adventurer Bones:
- The most popular gems use is to get adventurer bones that give a chance (typically 4-5%) to obtain new Legendary characters or new skins for existing characters.
- Limited time special bones are available from the Jeweler and typically cost 200 gems each, or 11 bones for 2000 gems.
- Limited bones usually give, along with the random character, one 'pity' token that can be exchanged at the jeweler.
- Typcially 100 (for legendary) or 60 (for non-legendary) tokens can be exchanged for bones that guarantee obtaining the banner character.
- Thus the minumum gem cost 100% guarantee getting the banner is:
    - 60: 5 x 2000 + 5 + 200 = 11,000 gems
    - 100: 9 x 2000 + 1 x 200 = 18,200 gems
    - Occasionally banner events include 2-4 free bones that sligthly reduce the above "guarantee" requirement.
    
#### Handbooks
- Ally class changes require class-change handbooks or similar items for every class change event for that character.
- Usually four class change books are randomly available each week at the Jeweler, at a cost of 400 gems each,with two limited to Purple Gems.

#### Inventory Storage Increase:
- The default inventory storage space is 500 slots (does not include item slots in an adventurer's personal inventory).
- The limit can be increased by 25 items for 100 gems up to 1000 slots for total of 2000 gems.
