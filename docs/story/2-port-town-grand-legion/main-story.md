# Abyss 2: Port Town Grand Legion

## Saving the Missing Person and Not Being Murdered

1. After winning your second arena battle and watching your missing person get blown up, use the wheel to go back in time to before fighting the second battle.
2. Find Butch and complete the [Obtaining KnightQuil](./requests-bondmates.md#obtaining-knightquil) request
3. After completing the quest, beat up your second arena battle opponent again and re-watch the scene. Your missing person lives this time\!
4. Proceed ahead with the remaining arena battles. After you beat Melgina, watch the scenes. Congratulations \- you lived, completed your request, and more importantly, received the lexicon that allows you to read the 7 mermaid statues you encountered\!

### Decision Point

From here, you have two options.

1. The first is to use the wheel to go back to the start and do a different faction request. This will effectively start you over in the Port Town Grand Legion and you will have to progress through the maps as if it was your first time, except you will have the lexicon, so you can read the mermaid statues as you come across them and pick up some very valuable information.
2. The second is to not start on a new faction request. Instead, within the same completed path, go around and read all the mermaid statues to again, pick up some very valuable information.

The path you choose is ultimately yours, and the only difference is with option 1, you will have to fight Melgina again before you are really able to fight Octonarus. Note that if you are trying to get the IQ Guiding Light, you’ll need to fight Melgina (not Octonarus) a second time anyway, so I personally took the first option because it made sense to me to just collect the mermaid statue knowledge as I went through the maps again. If you do take option 1, this same decision point applies at the end where you can either repeat option 1 for the third faction or move on to option 2\.

## Octonarus

Once you’re ready to fight Octonarus, you first need to learn about him by reading the 7 mermaid statues throughout the map. This assumes you have that knowledge and know about his existence. Note that these steps are the identical steps needed to get [Melgina as a bondmate](./requests-bondmates.md#melgina). If you do not take these steps and just call out Octonarus’ name instead of fighting Melgina during the 5th arena battle, you will end up in a battle with Octonarus where he will resurrect Melgina indefinitely. Not fun\!

1. Use the wheel to travel back to **One-Eyed Sahuagin** and speak to the Gessi destroying the statue using the “**Don’t you want to save Melgina**” option
2. Use the wheel to travel back to **Flooded Town** and speak with Melgina using the “**Do you want to be free from Octonarus**” option
3. Complete the [Rustproof Knife Delivery](./requests-bondmates.md#rustproof-knife-delivery) request that Melgina gives you instead of getting her the mackerel sandwich
4. Complete the [Titanium Ore Delivery](./requests-bondmates.md#titanium-ore-delivery) request to \`have the blacksmith make it and give it to Melgina
5. Use the wheel to travel back to **One-Eyed Sahuagin** and talk to Gessi again, using the “**Dont you want to save Melgina**” and “**I understand, Gessi**” options
6. Complete the [Obtaining Titanium Ore](./requests-bondmates.md#obtaining-titanium-ore) request
    1. Note that if you want Gessi’s help against Octo, when you do the next step, make sure you configure the wheel so that you did not give the Purple Garlic to the head cook
7. Use the wheel to travel back to **Arena Round 5** and after defeating Geuzan, engage Melgina with the “**Melgina's liberation**” option
8. You now get to fight Octonarus
    1. As part of this fight, you will still have to fight Melgina first, and she will resurrect once (you will have to fight her twice), however she will refuse resurrection after that
    2. You cannot request healing prior to this fight, so make sure you conserve what you can while fighting Geuzan, and bring some potions to heal up as needed before engaging Melgina
