## Unique Skill (Inheritable): Wisdom of Truth

Eliminates dampening of damage from types the user is at a disadvantage with a chance to reduce damage when user is attacked (affected by Luck). Damage reduction amount/rate are reduced if learned by someone other than Adam.

## Unique Skill (Not Inheritable): Knowledge of the Millennial Lord

Continuously reduces the MP cost of Mage spells that cost 6 SP or less.

## Discipline Skill: Will of the Millennial Lord

Continuously increases each stat, Magic Power and Action Speed increased further.

# TheAxolotl's Analysis:

Adam provides very consistent damage and longevity for a mage due to his two unique skills. Reducing the dampening of damage means he's not as impacted when fighting enemies that are strong against Light damage. His main downside is that he innately only can deal Light damage. This can be offset by inheriting some single target spells that deal other elements of damage, however without the inheritance, he will only have an elemental advantage against enemies weak to light.

His inheritable unique skill gets an extra nod in that if it is inherited by another character, that character will receive the full bonus of the damage dampening. This has incredible potential to boost the damage dealt by the MC (or your favorite damage dealers) and makes his duplicates extremely valuable to have.

Compared to Yekaterina, his damage will generally be more consistent, and he will be able to cast more spells overall, however he will be missing out on the bonus damage to undead and multiple innate elemental type coverages. This can be overcome by inheriting other spells on him to give him additional elemental coverage. Early game, the extra longevity will be nice, but will become less relevant as MP pools get higher and MP potions become obtainable. Still, he's an excellent pull and you have many options for spending his duplicates.

# Duplicate Usage:

1. If you like Adam and plan to use him on your team, boosting his Discipline level will increase his damage
2. Inherit his skill on your MC
3. Inherit his skill on your other favorite damage dealers or save for future use

# Alice

**Type**: Water  
**Personality**: Evil  
**Starting Class**: Priest  
**Role**: Healing, Support, Damage

# Skills

## Unique Skill (Inheritable): Blessing of Agora

Adds 1 consecutive turn to buffs and debuffs applied by the user and increases MP. MP increase amount and growth amount of consecutive turns are reduced if learned by someone other than Alice.

## Unique Skill (Not Inheritable): Agent of Heresy

Increases damage to enemies for everyone in a row if it has only evil or neutral allies.

## Discipline Skill: Ira's Divine Protection

Continuously increases Divine Power.

# TheAxolotl's Analysis:

Alice is a fantastic unit to pull, and will likely be a staple in most folks' parties for a long while. Not only is she our only Legendary priest, but both of her skills are fantastic. Increasing her buff/debuff turn count by 1 means she gets an extra turn to heal, deal damage, or apply another buff/debuff before needing to reapply the initial. Furthermore, her damage increase to a row can apply to our current best damage dealers (Adam, Yeka, Gerulf, and a Neutral or Evil MC). Alice is no slouch in the damage department herself, either, being able to hit hard with single target Light damage that is based on her Divine Power and also deals increased damage to undead. Giving her Discipline levels will further increase her damage and healing potential.

To make things even better, many other characters will benefit from Alice duplicates. Inheriting her skill on your other favorite buffers/debuffers will allow them to each provide an extra turn for their buffs/debuffs\!

It has been reported that the turn duration increase from her Blessing of Agora skill adds one to the counter at rank three, so it's possible to get at least a 5-turn duration on buffs and debuffs, which adds to the strength increasing her skill through inheritence.

You absolutely want to get Alice on your team\!

**NOTE: There is potentially a bug with inheriting Alice's skill (or maybe with the skill itself). I merged an Alice copy to MC and do not see any turn count increases for Warrior's  Battle Cry, Self-Healing, or the debuff from Armor Break. I've reported this and will hopefully hear back about it at some point.**

# Duplicate Usage:

1. If you plan to use Alice (you should), increasing her Discipline will increase her damage and healing.
2. Inherit her skill on other buffers/debuffers you use. Note that this should include any damage dealers that have self-buffing or boss-debuffing capabilities. See note above for potential bug.
3. Save for future use.

# Debra

**Type**: Light  
**Personality**: Neutral  
**Starting Class**: Thief  
**Role**: Support, Damage

# Skills

## Unique Skill (Inheritable): Blessing of the Beastfolk Goddess

Defeating an enemy restores minor SP to self. Recovery amount is reduced if learned by someone other than Debra.

## Unique Skill (Not Inheritable): Skull Study

Continuously reduces the SP cost of Thief skills that cost 6 SP or less.

## Discipline Skill: Blessing of the Beast God

Continuously increases each stat, Attack Power and Paralysis tolerance increased further.

# TheAxolotl's Analysis:

Debra is our first Legendary thief, and she is great at it. She can deal strong damage for a thief, particularly later on when you have both Hiding and Sneak Attack unlocked. Her skills also allow her to regularly use Precision Strike to kill enemies for a net 0 SP use. When fighting bosses, her debuffs can be very helpful, with an extra nod to Delay Attack.

That being said, it's very likely that other thieves might be released in the future that end up powercreeping her, and a thief MC could very well end up actually being better at being a thief than she is. She's extremely helpful to have now, but it's hard to say if she'll remain strong in the future. One extra note is that inheriting Debra's skill on other characters at very high levels can restore large amounts of SP upon kill.

# Duplicate Usage:

1. If you use her, increasing her Discipline will increase her damage.
2. Save for future use. It's possible that she'll end up becoming a good candidate in the future to dismiss for Grade tags.
3. Inheriting her skill on your MC (or other physical damage dealers) can help them out a bit. At skill level 1, the SP restore is minimal (2 sp per kill) but the inheritance value will go up as that inherited skill level increases.

# Gerard

**Type**: Wind  
**Personality**: Good  
**Starting Class**: Knight  
**Role**: Damage, Support

# Skills

## Unique Skill (Inheritable): Thunderstrike

Moderate wind type physical attack on 1 enemy. Low chance of inflicting Paralysis on target. Damage is reduced if learned by someone other than Gerard.

## Unique Skill (Not Inheritable): Lightning Celerity

Increases Evasion when equipped with a one-handed sword.

## Discipline Skill: Thundersmiter's Protection

Continuously increases each stat, Evasion and Action Speed increased further.

# TheAxolotl's Analysis:

I'll preface this with the fact that I did not pull on Gerard, so these are my thoughts on his kit as opposed to his performance. By all means, I welcome the analysis of someone who has him and has used him.

Gerard strikes me as a bit of a hybrid between Lanavaille and Gerulf, as he is a Knight that is focused more on damage and evasion than full protection. His unique skill is an attack that presumably has a similar damage modifier to Gerulf's with an added bonus of having a chance to inflict paralysis. The thing that strikes me as odd, though, is the fact that he's evasion-focused, yet the standard Knight skills tend to benefit from higher Defense Power. To get higher evasion, you'll usually be wearing lighter armor which by default will have lower Defense Power than heavier armor. That's not a bad thing in itself, but it does make me think you'd have to either spread your stat emphasis across too many values or ignore some element of his kit to really optimize him during use. Since his unique skill is an attack, I would favor gearing similarly to the MC or a thief, and treating him like a fighter.

Since he has a Good personality, he would fit well on the front line with Lana and be able to receive her personality damage boost, so that could let him go toe-to-toe with Gerulf from a damage perspective while similarly being a bit less of a glass cannon due to being able to use Thunderstrike with a 1h and Shield combination.

I don't believe Gerard is bad by any means, but I think he's a bit less compelling to use than a front-line Debra, despite the fact that he'd likely live longer if hit and deal more overall damage.

# Duplicate Usage:

1. If you use him, Discipline will increase his damage.
2. Inherit on his own skill will increase the damage and cost of his Thunderstrike.
3. Save for future use. He is also a current candidate to dismiss for Grade tags, although if you're going to dismiss him, why spend the resources to pull on him to begin with?

# Gerulf

**Type**: Fire  
**Personality**: Evil  
**Starting Class**: Fighter  
**Role**: Damage

# Skills

## Unique Skill (Inheritable): Eruption Strike

Moderate fire type physical attack on 1 enemy. Increases Accuracy when equipped with a two-handed blunt weapon and boosts damage. Damage is reduced if learned by someone other than Gerulf. \<Close/mid-range weapon-specific\>

## Unique Skill (Not Inheritable): Branded Hands

Increases Accuracy when equipped with a two-handed weapon.

## Discipline Skill: Fire Demonâ€™s Brand

Continuously increases each stat and Surety while Attack Power is increased further.

# TheAxolotl's Analysis:

Gerulf does one thing and one thing well. He hits hard with a 2h mace. If you're not using him with a 2h mace, he's not living up to his full potential. Unfortunately, there are some things that work against him right now. Since he's evil, he will actually hinder a party that uses Lanavaille, as both of them want to be in the front row and having them both there will negate Lanavaille's row buff. This likely won't be a permanent limitation, though, since in the future we should be able to build a strong Neutral/Evil front row.

While his Eruption Strike can be inherited on another character, like your MC, it will not be at full strength. While having a Fire element attack could be helpful, it's hard to say if the reduced damage elemental strike would be stronger than Heavy Attack or Precision Strike, but I suspect not.

If you like him, by all means use him. He has great future potential, however at the time of game launch, I think he is one of the weaker Legendary choices.

# Duplicate Usage:

1.  If you use him, Discipline will increase his damage.
2. Save for future use. He is also a current candidate to dismiss for Grade tags.
3. Inherit on his own skill will increase the damage and cost of his Eruption Strike.

# Lanavaille

**Type**: Fire  
**Personality**: Good  
**Starting Class**: Knight  
**Role**: Support, Damage

# Skills

## Unique Skill (Inheritable): Queen of War and Love

Restores minor HP to all allies upon winning a battle. Recovery amount is reduced if learned by someone other than Lanavaille.

## Unique Skill (Not Inheritable): Stirring Righteousness

Increases damage to enemies for everyone in a row if it has only good or neutral allies.

## Discipline Skill: Warrior Princess of Resolution and Love

Continuously increases each stat, Defense Power and Confusion/Charm Tolerance increased further.

# TheAxolotl's Analysis:

Lanavaille is our first Legendary Knight, and she's pretty great at it\! Not only does she provide defensive capabilities, her ability to buff a Good/Neutral row can be very powerful, particularly if you have a Good/Neutral MC. A front row of Lanavaille \- MC \- Debra is very common at the moment, and all three units would benefit from the increased damage.

In addition to her battle prowess, Lanavaille's end of battle heal is extremely valuable early game. The initial heal amount is 12, and it increases (by 10 or 12 alternating) with each skill level. While this does become less impactful when you get up to level 20+, it's still nothing to frown upon, and it can absolutely be a life saver in the early game.

Lanavaille has quite a few options for duplicate use, and it's arguable which is the best. Increasing her skill level will make her end of battle heal continue to provide value at later levels, and increasing her Discipline level will allow her to deal more damage with Stun Bash and receive less damage. Alternatively, inheriting her skill on the MC would allow you to continue to receive a post-battle heal (albeit reduced) when future Knights (or other classes) get released that render her less useful.

If you get her now, absolutely put her in her party, however she is likely going to be powercrept by other units going forward, particularly if more come along that provide personality-oriented buffs.

# Duplicate Usage:

1. If you use her, Discipline is always a good choice.
2. Inherit her own skill to increase its healing power or inherit to the MC.
3. Save for future use. It's possible that she'll end up becoming a good candidate in the future to dismiss for Grade tags.

# Yekaterina

**Type**: Earth  
**Personality**: Neutral  
**Starting Class**: Mage  
**Role**: Damage, Support

# Skills

## Unique Skill (Inheritable): Eye of Kalshum

Continuously increases Detect with a chance to nullify an enemy's ambush. Detect increase amount and chance of ambush nullification are reduced if learned by someone other than Yekaterina.

## Unique Skill (Not Inheritable): Advice of the Skull

Increases damage against undead and decreases damage from undead.

## Discipline Skill: Future Dreamt with the Skull

Continuously increases each stat, MP and Skill-Bind/Spell-Bind Tolerance increased further.

# TheAxolotl's Analysis:

Yeka, like Adam, is one of our powerhouse damage dealers. While she will be impacted by unfavorable type matchups, she innately provides both Earth and Water damage. In addition, she can learn Fire and Wind damage through inheriting spells. This, along with her bonus damage to undead, makes her a very heavy hitting for the first and second areas. Her MP reservoir is not as deep as Adam's, but she trades the longevity for hitting harder.

Her ambush prevention skill is also nothing to shrug off. Some people report that they don't get much value out of it, however I've personally seen roughly half of the ambushes I've had pop up be prevented, and that's pretty great. To make things even better for Yeka, she's a Neutral alignment which has the potential to make her a bit more future-proof than Adam when it comes to team formation. Lastly, if you inherit Adam's skill on her, she'll be able to get the have damage dampening, which will likely be useful, particularly when you're not sure what an enemy's weakness is. In addition that, her Neutral personality has the potential to make her more flexible for team compositions, but this may or may not be the case long-term, since we don't know what future releases will look like.

One big downside to Yeka is that her Discipline levels do not boost her Magic Power and Action Speed the way Adam's do, however it's very likely that having her Skill/Spell-Bind tolerance boosted will be quite useful in the future.

Yeka is a boon to have on any team and due to the ability to hit multiple weaknesses, deal increased damage against undead, and prevent ambushes, she'll likely remain a staple party member for a long time\!

# Duplicate Usage:

1. If you use her, boosting her Discipline or her anti-ambush skill will be great.
2. Save for future use.
