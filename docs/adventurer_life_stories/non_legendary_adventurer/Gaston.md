Gaston was born near the capital as the middle son of a local lord, and grew up always being compared to his older and younger brothers.

His older brother was gifted in all manner of things, while the younger one was quick-witted and good with people. All Gaston had was his ego, fueling a desire to never be outdone. He despised hard work, had little patience, and sought after results without putting in effort.

In his academic life, Gaston eschewed the basics, choosing instead to shallowly repeat maxims and the words of great men. This attitude carried over to his swordsmanship, in which he favored flashy techniques over fundamentals, to the point his master told him never to return.

No matter the airs he put on, his family would still call him a failure.
