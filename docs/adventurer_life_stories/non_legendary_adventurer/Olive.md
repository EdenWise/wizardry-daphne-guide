At the age of 10, Olive was separated from her family. The elven settlement she lived in was fleeing disaster and Olive, just wanting to see the erupting volcano, turned back to look and was left behind.

Along the way, she came across some humans who hadn't managed to escape the eruption, and led them along a safe path through the forest. In gratitude, the humans brought her to a place near the capital since the elf had nowhere else to go.

Olive found herself in a camp full of refugees who had built simple huts to protect themselves from the elements.

Now a stray elf, she gathered firewood to offer those in need in exchange for food or shelter.

Some time later, she found work watching adventurers' belongings. She would guard their camps and possessions while their expeditions took them away for days at a time.

The adventurers taught Olive how to fight and told her to protect their food and provisions with her life. Protecting their goods from thieves and wild beasts mean she would receive money and go on living. But if she failed, they would beat her senseless.

Olive trained desperately how to fight, learning how to attack a beast's vital spots and set up traps to catch thieves. She also learned how to bargain to protect her life or the provisions.

When she turned 15, Olive joined the Adventurer's Guild, as it was the only occupation available for a stray elf like her.

Even so, she found satisfaction in her way of living.

Three years later, an elf arrived at the guild searching for his missing sister. It was Olive's older brother. The reunited siblings were overjoyed and he brought her to the village where her family now lived. Olive was finally one of the elves again.

There in the village, when asked about how she had survived on her own, Olive told of working for adventurers and how she was now an adventurer, too.

However, her parents and the other old-fashioned elves frowned when she spoke about working under a group of such lowly humans.

Her parents and the village elder scolded her for tarnishing the pride of the elves, saying "To stoop so low as to work for humans."

And so, after only three months of living in the village, Olive eventually said goodbye to her family.

From there on, Olive lived as an adventurer in the capital.

She knew very well that an elf's pride could not fill her belly and how the elven way of life was now no longer for her.

Olive was often known to say over a drink that "It's just easier to live among humans."
