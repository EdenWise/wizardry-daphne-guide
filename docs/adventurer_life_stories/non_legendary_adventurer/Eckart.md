In dwarven territory southeast of the capital, Eckart was born the second son of a knight. His family had resided there for generations, and the area was abundant in precious metals.

Since the mines held great riches, surrounding lords targeted them many times. Each time, it was the lord and his knights that came to the defense of the land and the citizens. It was just as Lord Barnabas would say, "Lords and knights are there to protect the land and the people."

After apprenticing, Eckardt himself swore the oath to his lord to protect the land and was formally knighted.
