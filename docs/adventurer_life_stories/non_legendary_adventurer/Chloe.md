Chloe was born in a smallish fishing village in the southwestern part of the continent. A plague took her parents' lives when she was still a babe, and so she was brought up by her grandparents.

Her grandparents had been persecuted fled from another country. They told her time and again of theirexperiences and how "humans are fearsome."

But the words of her grandparents fell flat with Chloe. The lands where their fishing village stood were relatively tolerant of other races, and nobody in the village discriminated against even the beastfolk.

Still, her grandmother would forbid her from leaving the village, fearing that humans outside might hurt her. Chloe thus grew up healthy in a village without persecution, and knowing little of the world.
