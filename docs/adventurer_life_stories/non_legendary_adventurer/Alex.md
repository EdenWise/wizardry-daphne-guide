Alex was born the fifth son of a lord who ruled over a remote area far away from the capital that had more animals and birds than it had people.

As a child, Alex was fascinated by a knight of his bedtime stories. With just his sword, the hero saved a kingdom and earned the adoration of its princess. Alex looked up to that knight and, after turning 10, decided to become the greatest knight in the kingdom.

Though his father wanted him to serve as secretary, Alex's passion was too great to ignore, and Alex was allowed to join the most demanding group of knights in the area. His father had assumed that Alex would come running back, but Alex excelled at training and became the best knight in the order.

Alex told his father that he wanted to put his sword skills to use and join the Royal Knights. His father strongly objected, telling Alex lay down his sword in return for the freedom he'd enjoyed all his life. This unprecedented argument prompted Alex to leave his family home.
