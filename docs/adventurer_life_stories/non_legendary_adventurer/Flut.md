Flut was born in a tiny elven settlement in the northern mountain range. Her parents were educated in basic spellcraft, giving Flut ample opportunities to see them use spells to stoke the hearth fire or fill pots with water from a very young age.

One day, trying to help her father in the vegetable garden, young Flut cast a spell as she'd seen done and ended up flooding the field.

Flut tearfully apologized for ruining the vegetables, but rather being angry, her father picked her up and praised her for using a spell without anyone teaching her, saying "my child is a genius."

Since then, Flut has been devoted to spellcraft.
