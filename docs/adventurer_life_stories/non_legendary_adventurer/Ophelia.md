Ophelia was born in a small mountain village in the south of the continent. She was the eldest of five children, with two brothers and two sisters.

Her parents, who still as close as newlyweds, were always busy working to put food on the table for their five children. From an early age Ophelia helped her parents with the cooking, cleaning, babysitting, and other chores.

Having always felt loved by her wonderful parents, Ophelia thought that if she were to marry, she'd want what her parents had.
