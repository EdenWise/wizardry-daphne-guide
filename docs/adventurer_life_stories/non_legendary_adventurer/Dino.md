Dino was a native of a mountainous region to the south, from a small town of elves that overlooked the sea.

The town is said to have been founded by elves who left the forest long ago, and through interaction with others, came to devote themselves to the research of spellcraft. Indeed, most elves living there were involved with spellcraft and research flourished when Dino was there.

Naturally curious, Dino had great affinity with spellcraft and absorbed knowledge quickly, becoming an excellent mage as a result.

Dino's curiosity did not merely stop at spellcraft; he wanted to know the reason and the structure of the world. Whenever he became engrossed in some new subject, he would completely ignore everything else, earning him the reputation as an eccentric in town.

After learning and researching spellcraft for 200 years in his hometown, Dino set off for the capital to satisfy his curiosity on various other matters.
