Daniel was born in Guerard, a town to the east of the plain that stretches across the center of the continent and home to a population of 1,000. His family rented horses for carrying cargo to the inn town.

Daniel was very big as a child. Being a kind and gentle soul, he'd often help his parents and was always concerned for their horses' health and wellbeing.

Once he turned 10, his father delegated work to him. His job was to go around asking merchants in town if they required horses.

When Daniel started going in to the town for work, the local children who saw him began teasing him as a yokel from the backcountry. With Daniel's timid nature, this bullying only escalated, and he'd be pushed around and even injured at times.

Upon hearing what was happening, Daniel's mother worried. However, not wanting to cause her worry, Daniel insisted he continue going in to town.

But, one day, Daniel found himself unable to go past the church at the town's entrance. He ran into the church and cried before God over his pathetic state.

The church's priest found Daniel and spoke to him. Daniel told him everything he had been enduring. Quietly, the priest listened to his story, gently comforting him and praising him for not retaliating. He then escorted Daniel back home.

But Daniel's father was angry that he would leave work unfinished. The priest admonished the man, and suggested Daniel help with services the church. Daniel's father told him to turn the boy around, and from then on, Daniel began spending time with the church priest.

The priest was a master of the mace. Daniel asked him why he, a servant of God, would spend his days training for combat.

The priest then told him that becoming stronger though training was necessary to protect the teachings, congregation, and one's own heart from the devil.

Moved by these words, Daniel begged the priest to teach him to wield weapons.

Three months later, Daniel resumed his duties. Once again, the town's children tried to push him around, but Daniel, chest out and looking forward, didn't budge. He'd become stronger both physically and mentally. Fearing this new Daniel, the children left him alone.

Having found tranquility and the desire to be a strong and gentle person like the priest, Daniel chose to serve God.

The soft-spoken Daniel would diligently spread the teachings of God while taking care of family business and occasionally visiting the Adventurer's Guild.
