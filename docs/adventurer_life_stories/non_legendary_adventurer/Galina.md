Galina was born the daughter of a long-standing family of priests in an elven settlement at the foot of a mountain range in the north.

Her mother gave birth to Galina after much difficulty and passed away soon after. Her father and grandfather pitied her for losing her mother at such a young age, but they were certain that it was a test from God. Galina was raised more strictly than other children, in an environment where lapses in faith were severely punished while acts of devotion were highly praised.

Galina's father and grandfather disciplined her strictly in accordance with their faith. They wanted for her to grow into a proud elf who would not be bullied or demeaned by others for growing up without a mother.

Galina eventually became the priest she was meant to be. A rigid one who could not abide ambiguity.
