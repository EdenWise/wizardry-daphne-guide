Clarissa was the daughter of a local lord in a northwestern duchy.

Her upbringing was a strict one, with her mother making sure to instruct her and her siblings to always conduct themselves in a manner befitting her station.

When a local quarrel grew into a conflict between factions in the duchy where her family resided, uneasy tidings of war began to permeate the land.

Her brothers began to train in swordsmanship so as be prepared if war ever came to the region. Clarissa, always different from her older sisters, also chose to train in the sword with her brothers.

She aspired to join the Order of Knights to do battle alongside her brothers if the time came.
