Viviana was an unwanted child, born to a slum bar prostitute in the royal capital who did not know who her father was.

She always yearned for her mother's love, but her mother seldom returned home and would always be drunk when she did. Neglected by the one who gave birth to her, Viviana grew up in the embrace of hunger, anxiety, and loneliness.

One day, unable to bear the pangs of hunger any longer, Viviana stole a small piece of bread from a street stall. After desperately fleeing from the angry stall keeper's shouts, Viviana, who had devoured the bread to save her own life, learned to steal as a way of survival.

She knew getting caught would be the end of her, and although many considered theft immoral, it was the only way she knew to survive. And so she began honing her skills so that no one would ever be able to catch her.
