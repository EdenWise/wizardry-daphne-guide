The remote village of Lacus is located even further north than the snowy forest. Elise was born in this tiny village, home to only about 20 elves.

The northern lands are always cold, and if the firewood were to run out, one would quickly freeze. The deep forests surrounding the village were also home to dangerous beasts that would attack them from time to time.

One day, all the able-bodied men of the village were out hunting when they were caught in an avalanche and none returned. The only men left in the village were either children or the elderly.

It now fell to the women to wield the swords to protect the village from wild beasts and the axes to harvest the firewood. Young Elise joined in this hard work alongside everyone else.

There was one old warrior who was injured and no longer able to fight. The women begged him to teach them the ways of the sword, that they might defend the village.

He didn't go easy on them because they were women, and his training was harsh, but there was one else to turn do the job. Desperate to learn, Elise acquired skills that even the old warrior had to recognize.

One time, a village child was kidnapped when they went into the forest. Ignoring the villagers' pleas not to, Elise gave pursuit on horseback to save the child.

Catching up to the kidnapper's wagon, Elise doggedly challenged the men aboard, though there were several of them and they were much larger than she.

The next thing Elise knew, she had the crying child in her arms. Realizing for the first time that she was capable of protecting the village, she felt confident in her own abilities.
