There are many rumors about Jarmil the Mage.

He lived in a dilapidated hut at the foot of a large tree by a village near the royal capital, but nobody knew exactly how long he had been living there and it was common for his hut to be empty for ten years at a time.

Even in the nearest village, there is no one who knows who Jarmil really is. Ask farmer or mayor, and all they have to say is "Supposedly he was an old man, even in my grandmother's day." or "He's looked the same ever since I was a child."

When asked, even longtime elven members of the guild would say "I've worked with him occasionally for the past 70 years or so, and he was already an old man when first I met him."
