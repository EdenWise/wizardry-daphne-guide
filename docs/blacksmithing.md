# Blacksmithing

## Basic Blacksmithing

### Extraction

Extracting destroys an item, with a small chance of producing an Alteration Stone or Refinement Stone that can be used to modify or increase substats on items.

The type of stone produced will be randomly selected from one of the substats on the item under extraction.

Only weapons, armor and accessories can be extracted.

### Refinement

Refining an item increases the value of a substat, and requires a Refinement Stone.

Refinement bonuses are lost when the substat is upgraded via Enchanting.

### Alteration

Refining an item modifies a substat, and requires an Alteration Stone.

Alteration has some nuanced behavior to it.

* If you didn’t alter a slot, after +5 the game locks you to only being able to alter a random slot that already passed its checkpoint (so at +5 you get locked to slot 1), and then may switch to a different slot when you pass that next slot’s checkpoint (at +10 it’s 50/50 for slots 1/2 and at +15 it’s 33/33/33 for 1/2/3 etc)
* If you altered a slot before +5, you get locked to that slot until you enhance to its checkpoint +1… and then the game will roll an equal chance to switch you to one of the other checkpointed slots (it may just leave you on the same slot you already altered)
* Altering a slot After it reached its checkpoint will remove both initial and checkpoint boosts

### Enhancement Inheritance

Enhancement Inheritance sacrifices an existing enchanted item to increase the enchantment value of another item.

This helps save gold when changing to higher quality equipment when you have already enchanted your existing equipment.

## Advanced Blacksmithing

### Advanced Extraction

The star quality of an item being extracted determines the magnitude of the stones produced. 

Extracting higher quality items results in larger boni granted by the stones.

**Tip:** Altering a high quality item with a low-grade Stone and then extracting the resulting item will result in a higher quality Stone, as the game only considers **item quality** and **type of available substats** when generating a Stone, not the magnitude of the substats.

Full Alteration

A **Full Alteration Stone** allows you to reroll all unlocked substats on an item.

It is a very rare outcome from **Extraction**.
